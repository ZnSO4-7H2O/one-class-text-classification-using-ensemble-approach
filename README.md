# One-Class-Text-Classification-using-Ensemble-Models
One class text classification using an ensemble of models. 
This work is done as part of my Master Thesis. 

The methods include:

Autoencoder <br /> 
One Class SVM <br /> 
Isolation Forest <br /> 
Ensemble using Majority Voting <br /> 
Ensemble using Neural Network <br /> 


One can download the entire repo and run the .py files. Alternately one can run jupyter notebooks as well.

Before running the files, download the embeddings from the following URLs:
