{"title": "Precoding and Spatial Modulation in the Downlink of MU-MIMO Systems", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This work focuses on the downlink communication of a multiuser MIMO system where the base station antennas and the users' receiving antennas are all active, but at each transmission, only a subset of the receive antennas is selected by the base station to receive the information symbols, and the particular chosen subset (pattern) represents part of the information conveyed to the user. In this paper we present a mathematical model for the system and develop expressions that are fairly general and adequate for its analysis. Based on these expressions we propose a procedure to optimize the choice by the ERB of the sets of antenna patterns to be used in the transmissions to the different users, aiming at the maximization of the detection signal-to-noise ratio. Performance results, with and without the optimization procedure, are presented for different scenarios.
