{"title": "The SARptical Dataset for Joint Analysis of SAR and Optical Image in  Dense Urban Area", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The joint interpretation of very high resolution SAR and optical images in dense urban area are not trivial due to the distinct imaging geometry of the two types of images. Especially, the inevitable layover caused by the side-looking SAR imaging geometry renders this task even more challenging. Only until recently, the \"SARptical\" framework [1], [2] proposed a promising solution to tackle this. SARptical can trace individual SAR scatterers in corresponding high-resolution optical images, via rigorous 3-D reconstruction and matching. This paper introduces the SARptical dataset, which is a dataset of over 10,000 pairs of corresponding SAR, and optical image patches extracted from TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images and aerial UltraCAM optical images. This dataset opens new opportunities of multisensory data analysis. One can analyze the geometry, material, and other properties of the imaged object in both SAR and optical image domain. More advanced applications such as SAR and optical image matching via deep learning [3] is now also possible.
