{"title": "Microwave Vortex Beam Launcher Design", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " A novel design for a vectorial vortex beam launcher in the microwave regime is devised. The beam is formed by launching a single guided transverse electric (TE) mode of a metallic circular waveguide into free-space. Excitation is achieved by the mean of an inserted coaxial loop antenna. Modal expansion coefficients are computed, and the resulting electric and magnetic fields are determined. The effect of the antenna location inside the waveguide on its effective input impedance is modelled using transmission-line relations and location for optimal matching is established. The analytical results are confirmed using multi-level fast multipole method full-wave simulations.
