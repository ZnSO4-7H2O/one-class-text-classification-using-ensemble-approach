{"title": "Synchronicity and pure bending of piezoelectric bimorphs: a new approach  to kinetic energy harvesting", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Kinetic energy harvesting with piezoelectric bimorphs has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Many works have been dedicated to the modelling and optimisation of the cantilevered geometry to increase power density, bandwidth, etc. The increased efficiency coming from the use of trapezoidal beams has been recognised, but little has been done to produce the same uniform strain within the most commonly available rectangular beams. This work proposes a new approach via a smart compliant structure which permits to deform a set of bimorphs in pure bending. Furthermore, since the deflections are synchronous, the power signals produced are in phase and power conditioning is simplified and made more efficient. The kinematic requirements for uniform strain are discussed, the novel structure is proposed and modelled with finite elements, a prototype is presented and characterised to support the modelling. The proposed structure induces almost perfectly uniform strain in the piezoelectric beams for all useful rotation angles, demonstrating that, compared to a traditional cantilever, twice as many charges can be produced when the same maximum strain is applied to the material. Synchronicity is also experimentally verified for the prototype, as power signals resulting from impact excitation are observed to be in phase. The principle of synchronous pure bending via helper structures can be applied in general to increase the performance of piezoelectric energy harvesters.
