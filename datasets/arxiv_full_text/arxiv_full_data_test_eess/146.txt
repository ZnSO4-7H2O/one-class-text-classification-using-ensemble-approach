{"title": "FDD Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Arbitrary 2D-Array Geometry", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper addresses the problem of downlink channel estimation in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The existing methods usually exploit hidden sparsity under a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) basis to estimate the cdownlink channel. However, there are at least two shortcomings of these DFT-based methods: 1) they are applicable to uniform linear arrays (ULAs) only, since the DFT basis requires a special structure of ULAs, and 2) they always suffer from a performance loss due to the leakage of energy over some DFT bins. To deal with the above shortcomings, we introduce an off-grid model for downlink channel sparse representation with arbitrary 2D-array antenna geometry, and propose an efficient sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) approach for the sparse channel recovery and off-grid refinement. The main idea of the proposed off-grid method is to consider the sampled grid points as adjustable parameters. Utilizing an in-exact block majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, the grid points are refined iteratively to minimize the off-grid gap. Finally, we further extend the solution to uplink-aided channel estimation by exploiting the angular reciprocity between downlink and uplink channels, which brings enhanced recovery performance.
