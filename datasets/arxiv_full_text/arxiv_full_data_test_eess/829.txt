{"title": "Modeling power angle spectrum and antenna pattern directions in  multipath propagation environment", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Most propagation models do not consider the influence of antenna patterns on the parameters and characteristics of received signals. This assumption is equivalent to the use of isotropic or omnidirectional antennas in these models. Empirical measurement results indicate that the radiation pattern, gain and direction of directional antennas significantly influence on properties of the received signal. This fact shows that consideration the directional antennas in propagation models is very important especially in the context of emerging telecommunication technologies such as beamforming or massive MIMO. The purpose of this paper is to present the modeling method of power angular spectrum and direction of antenna patterns in a multipath propagation environment.
