{"title": "Directional and Causal Information Flow in EEG for Assessing Perceived  Audio Quality", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements are used to infer change in cortical functional connectivity in response to change in audio stimulus. Experiments are conducted wherein the EEG activity of human subjects is recorded as they listen to audio sequences whose quality varies with time. A causal information theoretic framework is then proposed to measure the information flow between EEG sensors appropriately grouped into different regions of interest (ROI) over the cortex. A new causal bidirectional information (CBI) measure is defined as an improvement over standard directed information measures for the purposes of identifying connectivity between ROIs in a generalized cortical network setting. CBI can be intuitively interpreted as a causal bidirectional modification of directed information, and inherently calculates the divergence of the observed data from a multiple access channel with feedback. Further, we determine the analytical relationship between the different causal measures and compare how well they are able to distinguish between the perceived audio quality. The connectivity results inferred indicate a significant change in the rate of information flow between ROIs as the subjects listen to different audio qualities, with CBI being the best in discriminating between the perceived audio quality, compared to using standard directed information measures.
