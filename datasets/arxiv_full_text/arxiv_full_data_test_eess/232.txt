Then it will demonstrate an application to the problem of constructing an all-optical modular multiplication circuit. That circuit implements a novel approximate version of the Montgomery multiplication algorithm that enables the calculation to be performed entirely in the analog domain. The results will be used to corroborate the feasibility of scaling the design up to 16-bits without the need for analog to digital conversions at intermediate steps.
