{"title": "Time-Series Based Thermography on Concrete Block Void Detection", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Using thermography as a nondestructive method for subsurface detection of the concrete structure has been developed for decades. However, the performance of current practice is limited due to the heavy reliance on the environmental conditions as well as complex environmental noises. A non-time-series method suffers from the issue of solar radiation reflected by the target during heating stage, and issues of potential non-uniform heat distribution. These limitations are the major constraints of the traditional single thermal image method. Time series-based methods such as Fourier transform-based pulse phase thermography, principle component thermography, and high order statistics have been reported with robust results on surface reflective property difference and non-uniform heat distribution under the experimental setting. This paper aims to compare the performance of above methods to that of the conventional static thermal imaging method. The case used for the comparison is to detect voids in a hollow concrete block during the heating phase. The result was quantitatively evaluated by using Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Favorable performance was observed using time-series methods compared to the single image approach.
