{"title": "Effect of High Frame Rates on 3D Video Quality of Experience", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we study the effect of 3D videos with increased frame rates on the viewers quality of experience. We performed a series of subjective tests to seek the subjects preferences among videos of the same scene at four different frame rates: 24, 30, 48, and 60 frames per second (fps). Results revealed that subjects clearly prefer higher frame rates. In particular, Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values associated with the 60 fps 3D videos were 55% greater than MOS values of the 24 fps 3D videos.
