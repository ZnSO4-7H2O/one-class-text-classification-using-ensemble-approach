{"title": "Practical Implementation of Adaptive Analog Nonlinear Filtering For  Impulsive Noise Mitigation", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " It is well known that the performance of OFDM-based Powerline Communication (PLC) systems is impacted by impulsive noise. In this work, we propose a practical blind adaptive analog nonlinear filter to efficiently detect and mitigate impulsive noise. Specially, we design an Adaptive Canonical Differential Limiter (ACDL) which is constructed from a Clipped Mean Tracking Filter (CMTF) and Quartile Tracking Filters (QTFs). The QTFs help to determine a real-time range that excludes outliers. This range is fed into the CMTF which is responsible for mitigating impulsive noise. The CMTF is a nonlinear analog filter and its nonlinearity is controlled by the aforementioned range. Proper selection of this range ensures the improvement of the desired signal quality in impulsive environment. It is important to note that the proposed ACDL behaves like a linear filter in case of no impulsive noise. In this context, the traditional matched filter construction is modified to ensure distortionless processing of the desired signal. The performance improvement of the proposed ACDL is due to the fact that unlike other nonlinear methods, the ACDL is implemented in the analog domain where the outliers are still broadband and distinguishable. Simulation results in PRIME (OFDM-based narrowband PLC system) demonstrate the superior BER performance of ACDL relative to other nonlinear approaches such as blanking and clipping in impulsive noise environments.
