{"title": "Tensor-Based Parameter Estimation of Double Directional Massive MIMO  Channel with Dual-Polarized Antennas", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The 3GPP suggests to combine dual polarized (DP) antenna arrays with the double directional (DD) channel model for downlink channel estimation. This combination strikes a good balance between high-capacity communications and parsimonious channel modeling, and also brings limited feedback schemes for downlink channel estimation within reach. However, most existing channel estimation work under the DD model has not considered DP arrays, perhaps because of the complex array manifold and the resulting difficulty in algorithm design. In this paper, we first reveal that the DD channel with DP arrays at the transmitter and receiver can be naturally modeled as a low-rank four-way tensor, and thus the parameters can be effectively estimated via tensor decomposition algorithms. To reduce computational complexity, we show that the problem can be recast as a four-snapshot three-dimensional harmonic retrieval problem, which can be solved using computationally efficient subspace methods. On the theory side, we show that the DD channel with DP arrays is identifiable under very mild conditions, leveraging identifiability of low-rank tensors. Numerical simulations are employed to showcase the effectiveness of our methods.
