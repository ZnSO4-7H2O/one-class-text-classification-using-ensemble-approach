{"title": "A Direct Method for the Transient Stability Analysis of Transmission  Switching Events", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose an energy-based method for the transient stability analysis of a power system transmission switching event. In this method the exit point of pseudo-fault trajectory is used to determine a relevant controlling unstable equilibrium point (CUEP) for a switching event, the stability of the switching event is then assessed based on the energy margin between the computed relevant CUEP and the post-switching initial point. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on switching events in the structure-preserving models of a heavily loaded version of the WSCC 9-bus 3-machine system, and the base case IEEE 145-bus 50-machine system. A scheme for the detailed analysis of power system switching events is then proposed.
