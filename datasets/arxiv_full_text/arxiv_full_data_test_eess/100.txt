It shows that employing Stokes vector receiver, transmitted digital carrier and Kramers-Kronig detection offers an effective way to de-rotate polarization multiplexed complex double side band signal without using a local oscillator at receiver. The impact of system parameters and configurations including carrier-to-signal-power ratio, guard band of the digital carrier, oversampling ratio and real MIMO is experimentally investigated. Finally, a record 480 Gb/s data rate over 80 km SSMF is achieved in a 60 Gbaud PDM-16QAM single carrier experiment with a BER below the threshold of 2.0x10-2 ", "text": "single wavelength gb/s direct
