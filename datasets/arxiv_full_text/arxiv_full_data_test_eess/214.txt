{"title": "OPARC: Optimal and Precise Array Response Control Algorithm -- Part I:  Fundamentals", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, the problem of how to optimally and precisely control array response levels is addressed. By using the concept of the optimal weight vector from the adaptive array theory and adding virtual interferences one by one, the change rule of the optimal weight vector is found and a new formulation of the weight vector update is thus devised. Then, the issue of how to precisely control the response level of one single direction is investigated. More specifically, we assign a virtual interference to a direction such that the response level can be precisely controlled. Moreover, the parameters, such as, the interference-to-noise ratio (INR), can be figured out according to the desired level. Additionally, the parameter optimization is carried out to obtain the maximal array gain. The resulting scheme is called optimal and precise array response control (OPARC) in this paper. To understand it better, its properties are given, and its comparison with the existing accurate array response control ($ {\\textrm A}^2\\textrm{RC} $) algorithm is provided. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed OPARC.
