{"title": "Cascaded Reconstruction Network for Compressive image sensing", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The theory of compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years, whose traditional iterative reconstruction algorithm is time-consuming. However, it has been reported deep learning-based CS reconstruction algorithms could greatly reduce the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two efficient structures of cascaded reconstruction networks corresponding to two different sampling methods in CS process. The first reconstruction network is a compatibly sampling reconstruction network (CSRNet), which recovers an image from its compressively sensed measurement sampled by a traditional random matrix. In CSRNet, deep reconstruction network module obtains an initial image with acceptable quality, which can be further improved by residual network module based on convolutional neural network. The second reconstruction network is adaptively sampling reconstruction network (ASRNet), by matching automatically sampling module with corresponding residual reconstruction module. The experimental results have shown that the proposed two reconstruction networks outperform several state-of-the-art compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms. Meanwhile, the proposed ASRNet can achieve more than 1 dB gain, as compared with the CSRNet.
