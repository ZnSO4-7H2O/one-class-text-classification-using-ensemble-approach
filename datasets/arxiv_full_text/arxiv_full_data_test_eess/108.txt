{"title": "Content-based Representations of audio using Siamese neural networks", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we focus on the problem of content-based retrieval for audio, which aims to retrieve all semantically similar audio recordings for a given audio clip query. This problem is similar to the problem of query by example of audio, which aims to retrieve media samples from a database, which are similar to the user-provided example. We propose a novel approach which encodes the audio into a vector representation using Siamese Neural Networks. The goal is to obtain an encoding similar for files belonging to the same audio class, thus allowing retrieval of semantically similar audio. Using simple similarity measures such as those based on simple euclidean distance and cosine similarity we show that these representations can be very effectively used for retrieving recordings similar in audio content.

database hence retrieves ﬁles correctly. overall illustrates system capable delivering content based retrieval audio recordings. show performance retrieval speciﬁc sound events. show average measure queries sound event class. space constraints able show performance numbers classes. table show performance sound events highest values lowest values. first note several classes able obtain reasonably high performance using learned representations. example wind blowing around retrieval actually belong sound class wind blowing. however also observe audio classes unusually average precisions. occurs combine labels different datasets similar events classes semantically treated separate classes like ’dog bark sound’ ’dog sound’ ’car horn sound’ ’car passing residential area’. hence problem sound
