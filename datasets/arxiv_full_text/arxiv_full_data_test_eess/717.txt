{"title": "Measuring Conflict in a Multi-Source Environment as a Normal Measure", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In a multi-source environment, each source has its own credibility. If there is no external knowledge about credibility then we can use the information provided by the sources to assess their credibility. In this paper, we propose a way to measure conflict in a multi-source environment as a normal measure. We examine our algorithm using three simulated examples of increasing conflict and one experimental example. The results demonstrate that the proposed measure can represent conflict in a meaningful way similar to what a human might expect and from it we can identify conflict within our sources.
