{"title": "Fast Fiber Orientation Estimation in Diffusion MRI from kq-Space  Sampling and Anatomical Priors", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " High spatio-angular resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) has been shown to provide accurate identification of complex fiber configurations, albeit at the cost of long acquisition times. We propose a method to recover intra-voxel fiber configurations at high spatio-angular resolution relying on a kq-space under-sampling scheme to enable accelerated acquisitions. The inverse problem for reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is regularized by a structured sparsity prior promoting simultaneously voxelwise sparsity and spatial smoothness of fiber orientation. Prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid is also assumed. A minimization problem is formulated and solved via a forward-backward convex optimization algorithmic structure. Simulations and real data analysis suggest that accurate FOD mapping can be achieved from severe kq-space under-sampling regimes, potentially enabling high spatio-angular dMRI in the clinical setting.
