{"title": "Correlation properties of signal at mobile receiver for different  propagation environments", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " An issue of the parameter selection in various branches of a multi-antenna receiver system determines its effectiveness. A significant effect on these parameters are correlation properties of received signals. In this paper, the assessment of the signal correlation properties for different environmental conditions is presented. The obtained results showed that depending on the receiver speed, the adaptive selection of the delays in the different RAKE receiver branches provide minimization of the correlation between the signals. Particularly low levels of the signal correlation could be obtained in complex propagation environments such as urban and bad urban.
