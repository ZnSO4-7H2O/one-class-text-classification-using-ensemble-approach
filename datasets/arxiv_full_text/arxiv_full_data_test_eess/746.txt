{"title": "Spectrum Sensing: Enhanced Energy Detection Technique Based on Noise  Measurement", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Spectrum sensing enables cognitive radio systems to detect unused portions of the radio spectrum and then use them while avoiding interferences to the primary users. Energy detection is one of the most used techniques for spectrum sensing because it does not require any prior information about the characteristics of the primary user signal. However, this technique does not distinguish between the signal and the noise. It has a low performance at low SNR, and the selection of the threshold becomes an issue because the noise is uncertain. The detection performance of this technique can be further improved using a dynamic selection of the sensing threshold. In this work, we investigate a dynamic selection of this threshold by measuring the power of noise present in the received signal using a blind technique. The proposed model was implemented and tested using GNU Radio software and USRP units. Our results show that the dynamic selection of the threshold based on measuring the noise level present in the received signal during the detection process increases the probability of detection and decreases the probability of false alarm compared to the ones of energy detection with a static threshold.
