zero-mean wide-sense stationary vector signal unknown spectral density matrix order estimate spectrum perform following steps. must point existence bounded coercive satisfying trivial general. feasibility problem addressed georgiou also e.g. ferrante paper shall always assume feasibility sense explained inﬁnitely many spectral densities would solve mainstream approach today remedy ill-posedness ﬁrst introduce prior matrix spectral density represents guess true density tries deﬁne entropy-like distance index spectral densities best solving constrained optimization problem work however attempt attack problem direction diﬀerent optimization continuation work ferrante parametric family spectral densities introduced certain parameter space space generalized moments studied. question whether solution parametric spectral estimation problem fact exists essentially left open ferrante recently existence result worked baggio paper approach question uniqueness solution even

optimization problem terms lagrange multiplier alternative matricial parametrization proposed studied georgiou problem asking preimage im+γ shown baggio continuous surjective open subsets linear space thus solution problem always exists. question whether solution unique. show next uniqueness indeed true prior special structure. diﬀeomorphism im+γ particular means solution depends continuously covariance data thus problem well-posed sense hadamard. proof application global inverse function theorem hadamard appears e.g. gordon theorem connected oriented boundary-less n-dimensional manifolds
