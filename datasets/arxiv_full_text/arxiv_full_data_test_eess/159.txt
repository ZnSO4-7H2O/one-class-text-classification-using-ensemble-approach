{"title": "BER Performance Analysis of Coarse Quantized Uplink Massive MIMO", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Having lower quantization resolution, has been introduced in the literature, as a solution to reduce the power consumption of massive MIMO and millimeter wave MIMO systems. In this paper, we analyze bit error rate (BER) performance of quantized uplink massive MIMO employing a few-bit resolution ADCs. Considering Zero-Forcing (ZF) detection, we derive a closed-form quantized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to achieve an analytical BER approximation for coarse quantized M-QAM massive MIMO systems, by using a linear quantization model. The proposed expression is a function of quantization resolution in bits. We further numerically investigate the effects of different quantization levels, from 1-bit to 4-bits, on the BER of three modulation types of QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM. Uniform and non-uniform quantizers are employed in our simulation.  Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that our approximate formula gives a tight upper bound for the BER performance of $b$-bit resolution quantized systems using non-uniform quantizers, whereas the use of uniform quantizers cause a lower performance for the same systems. We also found a small BER performance degradation in coarse quantized systems, for example 2-3 bits QPSK and 3-4 bits 16-QAM, compared to the full-precision (unquantized) case. However, this performance degradation can be compensated by increasing the number of antennas at the BS.
