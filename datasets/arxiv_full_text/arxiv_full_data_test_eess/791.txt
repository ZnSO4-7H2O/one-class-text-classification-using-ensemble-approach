The aim of this article is to show that this standard provides a framework that could promote the introduction of applications into the market. Thus, these specifications could be further developed, reducing the gap between the industry and research communities. The implemented prototype makes use of software defined radio platforms to interface between the analog devices and the computer where the signal processing is performed.
