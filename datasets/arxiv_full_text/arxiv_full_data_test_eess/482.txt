{"title": "Development of Highly Efficient Multi-invariable Wireless Sensor System  Design for Energy Harvesting", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Capillary wireless sensor networks devoted to air quality monitoring have provided vital information on dangerous air conditions. In adopting the environmentally generated energy as the fundamental energy source the main challenge is the implementation of capillary networks rather than replacing the batteries on a set period of times that leads to functional dilemma of devices management and high costs. In this paper we present a battery-less, self-governing, multi-parametric sensing platform for air quality monitoring that harvests environment energy for long run. Furthermore study on sensor section with their results have also been described in the paper. A customized process of calibration to check the sensors' sensitivity and a basic portfolio of variant energy sources over the power recovery section could productively improve air quality standards tracing in indoor and outdoor application, in a kind of 'set and forget' scenario.
