{"title": "Optimal Energy Management Strategies in Wireless Data and Energy  Cooperative Communications", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper presents a new cooperative wireless communication network strategy that incorporates energy cooperation and data cooperation. The model establishment, design goal formulations, and algorithms for throughput maximization of the proposed protocol are presented and illustrated using a three-node network with two energy harvesting (EH) user nodes and a destination node. Transmission models are established from the performance analysis for a total of four scenarios. Based on the models, we seek to find optimal energy management strategies by jointly optimizing time allocation for each user, power allocations over these time intervals, and data throughputs at user nodes so as to maximize the sum-throughput or, alternatively, the minimum throughput of the two users in all scenarios. An accelerated Newton barrier algorithm and an alternative algorithm based on local quadratic approximation of the transmission models are developed to solve the aforementioned optimization problems. Numerical experiments under practical settings provide supportive observations to our performance analysis.
