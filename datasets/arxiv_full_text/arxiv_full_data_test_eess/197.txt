{"title": "WiBall: A Time-Reversal Focusing Ball Method for Indoor Tracking", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " With the development of the Internet of Things technology, indoor tracking has become a popular application nowadays, but most existing solutions can only work in line-of-sight scenarios, or require regular re-calibration. In this paper, we propose WiBall, an accurate and calibration-free indoor tracking system that can work well in non-line-of-sight based on radio signals. WiBall leverages a stationary and location-independent property of the time-reversal focusing effect of radio signals for highly accurate moving distance estimation. Together with the direction estimation based on inertial measurement unit and location correction using the constraints from the floorplan, WiBall is shown to be able to track a moving object with decimeter-level accuracy in different environments. Since WiBall can accommodate a large number of users with only a single pair of devices, it is low-cost and easily scalable, and can be a promising candidate for future indoor tracking applications.
