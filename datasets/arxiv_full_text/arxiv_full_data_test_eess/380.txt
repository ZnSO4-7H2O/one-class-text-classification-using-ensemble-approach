{"title": "Face Synthesis with Landmark Points from Generative Adversarial Networks  and Inverse Latent Space Mapping", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Facial landmarks refer to the localization of fundamental facial points on face images. There have been a tremendous amount of attempts to detect these points from facial images however, there has never been an attempt to synthesize a random face and generate its corresponding facial landmarks. This paper presents a framework for augmenting a dataset in a latent Z-space and applied to the regression problem of generating a corresponding set of landmarks from a 2D facial dataset. The BEGAN framework has been used to train a face generator from CelebA database. The inverse of the generator is implemented using an Adam optimizer to generate the latent vector corresponding to each facial image, and a lightweight deep neural network is trained to map latent Z-space vectors to the landmark space. Initial results are promising and provide a generic methodology to augment annotated image datasets with additional intermediate samples.
