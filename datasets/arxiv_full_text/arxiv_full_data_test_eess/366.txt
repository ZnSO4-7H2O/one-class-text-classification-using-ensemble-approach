{"title": "Analytical modeling and analysis of interleaving on correlated wireless  channels", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Interleaving is a mechanism universally used in wireless access technologies to alleviate the effect of channel correlation. In spite of its wide adoption, to the best of our knowledge, there are no analytical models proposed so far. In this paper we fill this void proposing three different models of interleaving. Two of these models are based on numerical algorithms while one of them allows for closed-form expression for packet error probability. Although we use block codes with hard decoding to specify the models our modeling principles are applicable to all forward error correction codes as long as there exists a functional relationship (possibly, probabilistic) between the number of incorrectly received bits in a codeword and the codeword error probability. We evaluate accuracy of our models showing that the worst case prediction is limited by 50\\% across a wide range of input parameters. Finally, we study the effect of interleaving in detail demonstrating how it varies with channel correlation, bit error rate and error correction capability. Numerical results reported in this paper allows to identify the optimal value of the interleaving depth that need to be used for a channel with a given degree of correlation. The reference implementations of the models are available [1].
