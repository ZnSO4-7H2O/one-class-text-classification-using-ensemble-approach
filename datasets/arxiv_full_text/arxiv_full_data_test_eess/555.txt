{"title": "Bounding Multivariate Trigonometric Polynomials with Applications to  Filter Bank Design", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The extremal values of multivariate trigonometric polynomials are of interest in fields ranging from control theory to filter design, but finding the extremal values of such a polynomial is generally NP-Hard. In this paper, we develop simple and efficiently computable estimates of the extremal values of a multivariate trigonometric polynomial directly from its samples. We provide an upper bound on the modulus of a complex trigonometric polynomial, and develop upper and lower bounds for real trigonometric polynomials. For a univarite polynomial, these bounds are tighter than existing bounds, and the extension to multivariate polynomials is new. As an application, the lower bound provides a sufficient condition to certify global positivity of a real trigonometric polynomial. We use this condition to motivate a new algorithm for multi-dimensional, multirate, perfect reconstruction filter bank design. We demonstrate our algorithm by designing a 2D perfect reconstruction filter bank.
