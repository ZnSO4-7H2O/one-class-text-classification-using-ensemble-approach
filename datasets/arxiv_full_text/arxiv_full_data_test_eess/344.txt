{"title": "The Temple University Hospital Seizure Detection Corpus", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " We introduce the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ), which is the largest open source corpus of its type, and represents an accurate characterization of clinical conditions. In this paper, we describe the techniques used to develop TUSZ, evaluate their effectiveness, and present some descriptive statistics on the resulting corpus.

brain identification neural disorders hemorrhagic stroke ischemia toxic metabolic encephalopathy recently interest diagnosing alzheimer’s head trauma sleep disorders many clinical applications involve collection large amounts data makes manual interpretation challenging. similarly increased eegs critical care created significant demand high-performance automatic interpretation software critical obstacle development machine learning technology applications lack data resources support training complex deep learning systems. popular transcribed seizure databases available research community chb-mit corpus consists subjects. though high performance achieved corpus results representative clinical performance therefore introduce seizure corpus largest open source corpus type represents accurate characterization clinical conditions. since seizures occur small fraction time type data manual annotation low-yield data would prohibitively expensive unproductive developed triage process locating seizure recordings. automatically selected data much larger corpus certain selection criteria. three approaches used identify files high probability seizure event occurred keyword search reports sessions likely contain seizures automatic detection seizure events using commercially available software automatic detection using experimental deep learning system data approaches agreement given highest priority. accurate annotation requires extensive training. reason manual annotation eegs usually done board-certified neurologists many years post-medical school training. consequently difficult transcribe large amounts data expertise short supply often focused clinical practice. previous attempts employ panels experts crowdsourcing strategies productive. however demonstrated viable alternative team highly trained undergraduates neural engineering data consortium temple university. students trained transcribe data seizure events accuracy levels rival expert neurologists fraction cost order validate team’s work portion annotations compared expert neurologists shown extremely high inter-rater agreement. build annotated seizure dataset first needed abundant source data. work utilized subset includes approximately eeg. data organized patient session. session contains signal data stored standard european data format de-identified report written board-certified neurologist. files contain variable number channels annotation process channels plus supplementary channels used. data annotated using open source annotation tool since less original data contains actual seizure events annotating entire database would costly inefficient. therefore used three independent approaches identify sessions likely contain actual seizure events. first applied natural language processing techniques identify reports keywords related ictal patterns. reports preprocessed using filters normalized stemmed text machine learning experiments conducted utilized term frequency-inverse document frequency features popular machine learning approaches negex naïve bayes support vector machines linear kernel functions trained recognize documents likely contain seizure terms. naïve bayes support vector machines algorithms used tf-idf features negex algorithm used features classification reports ictal nonictal. algorithms seeded reports describing occurrence seizure reports describing non-occurrence seizure. three algorithms tested reports negex performing slightly better naïve bayes classifiers. classification reports using negex performed using regular expression rule-based approach. regular expression labels selected based negation context affirmation negation labels selected based three different types negations prenegation post-negation pseudo-negation negex correctly classified reports used pilot study reports. applied sessions sessions identified likely seizure. sessions manual annotation determined sessions actual seizures. contained seizure events. third method used experimental seizure detection system known autoeeg system detected seizures high confidence files files. files systems agreed seizure given highest priority annotation. automated tools agreed files corpus. total number sessions identified least seizure either tool using three approaches identified sessions containing files original sessions high-yield data meaning likely contain seizures. annotation team manually annotated data sessions found sessions contained actual seizure events. interesting note three approaches identifying high yield data keyword search proved effective. automated seizure detection algorithms still suffer poor performance especially short duration seizure events. recent release tusz released december contains subjects total sessions sessions contain seizures. file completely transcribed ways channel-based term-based. channel-based annotation refers labeling start time event specific channel. term-based annotation refers summarization channel-based annotations channels share annotation aggregation per-channel annotations. seiz seizure gnsz generalized non-specific seizure fnsz focal

seizure labels time-aligned manner using open source visualization annotation tool deep learning technology address problems seizure detection large amounts annotated data needed. tusz world’s largest publicly available corpus annotated data seizure detection unencumbered. data sharing agreements needed access data. entire database consists hours data. seizure events comprise hours data annotated. version corpus contains hours data. completed processing data seizure events estimate overall yield seizure data using process described paper since accessing pruned eegs overall yield continuous data

tusz contains rich variety seizure morphologies. variation onset termination frequency amplitude locality focality protect evaluation training sets bias towards type seizure morphology. models trained using database strengthened obvious subtle seizure morphologies potential better prepared applications handling real world data. seizures biological process build gradually often lacking discrete start stop times. eventbased term-based annotations therefore included corpus effort represent different views seizure evolution duration. event-based annotations per-channel annotations give users detailed account brain seizure originates spreads terminates term-based annotations every channel simply include earliest seizure start time latest seizure time. address issue multi-class biclass annotations made available. multi-class annotations provide users specific data type seizure occurring bi-class annotations simply answer question seizure occurring not? working continuously improve
