{"title": "Micro Hand Gesture Recognition System Using Ultrasonic Active Sensing", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a micro hand gesture recognition system and methods using ultrasonic active sensing. This system uses micro dynamic hand gestures for recognition to achieve human-computer interaction (HCI). The implemented system, called hand-ultrasonic gesture (HUG), consists of ultrasonic active sensing, pulsed radar signal processing, and time-sequence pattern recognition by machine learning. We adopt lower frequency (300 kHz) ultrasonic active sensing to obtain high resolution range-Doppler image features. Using high quality sequential range-Doppler features, we propose a state-transition-based hidden Markov model for gesture recognition. This method achieves a recognition accuracy of nearly 90\\% by using symbolized range-Doppler features and significantly reduces the computational complexity and power consumption. Furthermore, to achieve higher classification accuracy, we utilize an end-to-end neural network model and obtain a recognition accuracy of 96.32\\%. In addition to offline analysis, a real-time prototype is released to verify our method's potential for application in the real world.
