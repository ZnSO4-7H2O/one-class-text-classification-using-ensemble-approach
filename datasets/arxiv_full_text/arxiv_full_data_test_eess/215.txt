Two computationally attractive parameter determination approaches are provided to maximize the array gain under certain constraints. In addition, the applications of the multi-point OPARC algorithm to array signal processing are studied. It is applied to realize array pattern synthesis (including the general array case and the large array case), multi-constraint adaptive beamforming and quiescent pattern control, where an innovative concept of normalized covariance matrix loading (NCL) is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the multi-point OPARC algorithm.
