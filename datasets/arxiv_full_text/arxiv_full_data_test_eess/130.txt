{"title": "Underlay Control Signaling for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency IoT  Communications", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Future mobile networks not only envision enhancing the traditional link quality and data rates of mobile broad band (MBB) links, but also development of new control channels to meet the requirements of delay sensitive use cases. In particular, the need for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) for many internet of things (IoT) users is greatly emphasized. In this paper, we present a novel spread spectrum waveform design that we propose for transmission of control signals to establish URLLC communications. These control signals are transmitted over the spectral resources that belong to the MBB communications in the network, but at a level that minimally affects these data channels. The proposed waveform, although a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique, is designed to take advantage of symbol synchronization available to the OFDM broad band communications in the network. This, clearly, allows simple synchronization with the rest of the network. The proposed DSSS method can transmit single and multiple bits within each OFDM time frame and can serve many user equipment (UE) nodes simultaneously.
