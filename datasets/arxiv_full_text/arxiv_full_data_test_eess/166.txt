{"title": "Practical Synchronization Waveform for Massive  Machine-Type-Communications", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " A general synchronization waveform type that is insensitive to frequency error for massive Internet-of-Things (mIoT) is derived in \"Robust synchronization waveform design for massive low-power IoT\" (IEEE Trans. on Wireless Commun., vol. 16, no. 11, pp. 7551-7559, Nov. 2017). Detailed issues such as (1) how to obtain the frequency error information from the waveform; (2) how to refine the timing estimation; and (3) how to adjust the waveform parameter to meet various spectral requirements are not addressed in the paper, and yet are of great importance for a practical application. These issues are discussed in this comment.
