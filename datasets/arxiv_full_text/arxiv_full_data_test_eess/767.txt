{"title": "Large Matrix Asymptotic Analysis of ZF and MMSE Crosstalk Cancelers for  Wireline Channels", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " We present asymptotic expressions for user throughput in a multi-user wireline system with a linear decoder, in increasingly large system sizes. This analysis can be seen as a generalization of results obtained for wireless communication. The features of the diagonal elements of the wireline channel matrices make wireless asymptotic analyses inapplicable for wireline systems. Further, direct application of results from random matrix theory (RMT) yields a trivial lower bound. This paper presents a novel approach to asymptotic analysis, where an alternative sequence of systems is constructed that includes the system of interest in order to approximate the spectral efficiency of the linear zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) crosstalk cancelers. Using works in the field of large dimensional random matrices, we show that the user rate in this sequence converges to a non-zero rate. The approximation of the user rate for both the ZF and MMSE cancelers are very simple to evaluate and does not need to take specific channel realizations into account. The analysis reveals the intricate behavior of the throughput as a function of the transmission power and the channel crosstalk. This unique behavior has not been observed for linear decoders in other systems. The approximation presented here is much more useful for the next generation G.fast wireline system than earlier digital subscriber line (DSL) systems as previously computed performance bounds, which are strictly larger than zero only at low frequencies. We also provide a numerical performance analysis over measured and simulated DSL channels which show that the approximation is accurate even for relatively low dimensional systems and is useful for many scenarios in practical DSL systems.
