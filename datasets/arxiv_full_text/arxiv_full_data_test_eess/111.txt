{"title": "Augmented Slepians: Bandlimited Functions that Counterbalance Energy in  Selected Intervals", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Slepian functions provide a solution to the optimization problem of joint time-frequency localization. Here, this concept is extended by using a generalized optimization criterion that favors energy concentration in one interval while penalizing energy in another interval, leading to the \"augmented\" Slepian functions. Mathematical foundations together with examples are presented in order to illustrate the most interesting properties that these generalized Slepian functions show. Also the relevance of this novel energy-concentration criterion is discussed along with some of its applications.
