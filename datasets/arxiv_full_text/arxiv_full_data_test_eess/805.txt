{"title": "Generalized Optimization of High Capacity Compressive Imaging Systems", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " One of the greatest challenges in applying compressive sensing (CS) signal processing techniques to electromagnetic imaging applications is designing a sensing matrix that has good reconstruction capabilities. Compressive reflector antennas (CRA) are a class of antennas that have been shown to provide enhanced image reconstruction performance over traditional reflector antennas (TRA) when CS techniques are employed. In this paper, we present a unified CRA design method, which considers both the sensing capacity and efficiency of the antenna, and can be used for both compressive imaging and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication applications. The unified design method is assessed for a CRA configuration in which dielectric scatterers are added to the surface of a TRA. The design results demonstrate the ability of the unified design method to enhance the CS reconstruction capabilities of the CRA.
