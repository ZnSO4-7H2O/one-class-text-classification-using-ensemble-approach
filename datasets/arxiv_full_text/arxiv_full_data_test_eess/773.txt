{"title": "3D Video Quality Metric for Mobile Applications", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we propose a new full-reference quality metric for mobile 3D content. Our method is modeled around the Human Visual System, fusing the information of both left and right channels, considering color components, the cyclopean views of the two videos and disparity. Our method is assessing the quality of 3D videos displayed on a mobile 3DTV, taking into account the effect of resolution, distance from the viewers eyes, and dimensions of the mobile display. Performance evaluations showed that our mobile 3D quality metric monitors the degradation of quality caused by several representative types of distortion with 82 percent correlation with results of subjective tests, an accuracy much better than that of the state of the art mobile 3D quality metric.
