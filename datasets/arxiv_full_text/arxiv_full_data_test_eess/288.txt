{"title": "Association fairness in Wi-Fi and LTE-U coexistence", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper we address the issue of association fairness when Wi-Fi and LTE unlicensed (LTE-U) coexist on the same channel in the unlicensed 5 GHz band. Since beacon transmission is the first step in starting the association process in Wi-Fi, we define association fairness as how fair LTE-U is in allowing Wi-Fi to start transmitting beacons on a channel that it occupies with a very large duty cycle. According to the LTE-U specification, if a LTE-U base station determines that a channel is vacant, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF for only 1 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 95%. In an area with heavy spectrum usage, there will be cases when a Wi-Fi access point wishes to share the same channel, as it does today with Wi-Fi. We study, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect that such a large LTE-U duty cycle can have on the association process, specifically Wi-Fi beacon transmission and reception. We demonstrate via an experimental set-up using National Instrument (NI) USRPs that a significant percentage of Wi-Fi beacons will either not be transmitted in a timely fashion or will not be received at the LTE-U BS thus making it difficult for the LTE-U BS to adapt its duty cycle in response to the Wi-Fi usage. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical analysis. We compare the results with Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence and demonstrate that LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence is not fair when it comes to initial association since there is a much larger percentage of beacon errors in the latter case. Hence, the results in the paper indicate that in order to maintain association fairness, a LTE-U BS should not transmit at such high duty cycles, even if it deems the channel to be vacant.
