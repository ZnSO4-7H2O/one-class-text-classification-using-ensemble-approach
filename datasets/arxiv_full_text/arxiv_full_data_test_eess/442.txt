{"title": "A new convolution theorem associated with the linear canonical transform", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we first introduce a new notion of canonical convolution operator, and show that it satisfies the commutative, associative, and distributive properties, which may be quite useful in signal processing. Moreover, it is proved that the generalized convolution theorem and generalized Young's inequality are also hold for the new canonical convolution operator associated with the LCT. Finally, we investigate the sufficient and necessary conditions for solving a class of convolution equations associated with the LCT.
