{"title": "Identification of GSM and LTE Signals Using Their Second-order  Cyclostationarity", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Automatic signal identification (ASI) has various millitary and commercial applications, such as spectrum surveillance and cognitive radio. In this paper, a novel ASI algorithm is proposed for the identification of GSM and LTE signals, which is based on the pilot-induced second-order cyclostationarity. The proposed algorithm provides a very good performance at low signal-to-noise ratios and short observation times, with no need for channel estimation, and timing and frequency synchronization. Simulations and off-the-air signals acquired with the ThinkRF WSA4000 receiver are used to confirm the findings.
