{"title": "Cross-Sensor Iris Recognition: LG4000-to-LG2200 Comparison", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Cross-sensor comparison experimental results reported here show that the procedure defined and simulated during the Cross-Sensor Comparison Competition 2013 by our team for migrating / upgrading LG2200 based to LG4000 based biometric systems leads to better LG4000-to-LG2200 cross-sensor iris recognition results than previously reported, both in terms of user comfort and in terms of system safety. On the other hand, LG2200-to-LG400 migration/upgrade procedure defined and implemented by us is applicable to solve interoperability issues between LG2200 based and LG4000 based systems, but also to other pairs of systems having the same shift in the quality of acquired images.
