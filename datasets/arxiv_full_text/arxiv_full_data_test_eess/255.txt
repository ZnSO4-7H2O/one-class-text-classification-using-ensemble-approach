{"title": "Multipath interference analysis of IR-UWB systems in indoor office LOS  environment", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Bit error rate (BER) performance of impulse radio Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems in the presence of intrasymbol interference, inter-symbol interference, multiuser interference and addictive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is presented in this paper. By analyzing the indoor office LOS channel model defined by IEEE 802.15.4a Task Group and deducing the variance for intra-symbol interference (IASI), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiuser interference (MUI), the system BER expression is obtained and verified by MATLAB simulations. Through comparing the simulation results with and without intra-symbol interference, the conclusion that intra-symbol interference cannot be neglected is drawn-moreover, such interference will significantly decrease performance of UWB based wireless sensor networks (WSN). Then, the BER performance of UWB systems in multiuser environment is also analyzed and analysis results show that multiuser interference will further worsen the transmission performance of UWB systems.
