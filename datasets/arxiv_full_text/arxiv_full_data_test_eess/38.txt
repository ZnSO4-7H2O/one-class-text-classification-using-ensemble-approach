{"title": "Covert Wireless Communication with Artificial Noise Generation", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Covert communication conceals the transmission of the message from an attentive adversary. Recent work on the limits of covert communication in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels has demonstrated that a covert transmitter (Alice) can reliably transmit a maximum of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ bits to a covert receiver (Bob) without being detected by an adversary (Warden Willie) in $n$ channel uses. This paper focuses on the scenario where other friendly nodes distributed according to a two-dimensional Poisson point process with density $m$ are present in the environment. We propose a strategy where the friendly node closest to the adversary, without close coordination with Alice, produces artificial noise. We show that this method allows Alice to reliably and covertly send $\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{{n,m^{\\gamma/2}\\sqrt{n}}\\})$ bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses, where $\\gamma$ is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, we also consider a setting where there are $N_{\\mathrm{w}}$ collaborating adversaries uniformly and randomly located in the environment and show that in $n$ channel uses, Alice can reliably and covertly send $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\min\\left\\{n,\\frac{m^{\\gamma/2} \\sqrt{n}}{N_{\\mathrm{w}}^{\\gamma}}\\right\\}\\right)$ bits to Bob when $\\gamma >2$, and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\min\\left\\{n,\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{N_{\\mathrm{w}}^{2}\\log^2 {N_{\\mathrm{w}}}}\\right\\}\\right)$ when $\\gamma = 2$. Conversely, we demonstrate that no higher covert throughput is possible for $\\gamma>2$.
