In this report, the presented metric is used to evaluate the quality of compressed stereo pair formed from a decoded view and a synthesized view. The performance of the proposed metric is verified through a series of subjective tests and compared with that of PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, VIFp, and VQM metrics. The experimental results show that HV3D has the highest correlation with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) compared to other tested metrics.
