{"title": "Optimal Control of Autonomous Vehicles Approaching A Traffic Light", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper devotes to the development of an optimal acceleration/speed profile for autonomous vehicles approaching a traffic light. The design objective is to achieve both short travel time and low energy consumption as well as avoid idling at a red light. This is achieved by taking full advantage of the traffic light information based on vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer programming, which is equivalently transformed into optimal control problems by relaxing the integer constraint. Then the direct adjoining approach is used to solve both free and fixed terminal time optimal control problems subject to state constraints. By an elaborate analysis, we are able to produce a real-time online analytical solution, distinguishing our method from most existing approaches based on numerical calculations. Extensive simulations are executed to compare the performance of autonomous vehicles under the proposed speed profile and human driving vehicles. The results show quantitatively the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and travel time.
