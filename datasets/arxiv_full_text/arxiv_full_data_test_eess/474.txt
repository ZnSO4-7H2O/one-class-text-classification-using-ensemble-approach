{"title": "OSLO: Automatic Cell Counting and Segmentation for Oligodendrocyte  Progenitor Cells", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Reliable cell counting and segmentation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are critical image analysis steps that could potentially unlock mysteries regarding OPC function during pathology. We propose a saliency-based method to detect OPCs and use a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to segment the OPCs. This method first implements frequency-tuned saliency detection on separate channels to obtain regions of cell candidates. Final detection results and internal markers can be computed by combining information from separate saliency maps. An optimal saliency level for OPCs (OSLO) is highlighted in this work. Here, watershed segmentation is performed efficiently with effective internal markers. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.
