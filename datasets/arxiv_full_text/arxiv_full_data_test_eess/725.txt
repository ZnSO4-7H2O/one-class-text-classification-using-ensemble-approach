{"title": "Cubic Spline Interpolation Segmenting over Conventional Segmentation  Procedures: Application and Advantages", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " To design a novel method for segmenting the image using Cubic Spline Interpolation and compare it with different techniques to determine which gives an efficient data to segment an image. This paper compares polynomial least square interpolation and the conventional Otsu thresholding with spline interpolation technique for image segmentation. The threshold value is determined using the above-mentioned techniques which are then used to segment an image into the binary image. The results of the proposed technique are also compared with the conventional algorithms after applying image equalizations. The better technique is determined based on the deviation and mean square error when compared with an accurately segmented image. The image with least amount of deviation and mean square error is declared as the better technique.
