{"title": "Improving Resource Efficiency with Partial Resource Muting for Future  Wireless Networks", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " We propose novel resource allocation algorithms that have the objective of finding a good tradeoff between resource reuse and interference avoidance in wireless networks. To this end, we first study properties of functions that relate the resource budget available to network elements to the optimal utility and to the optimal resource efficiency obtained by solving max-min utility optimization problems. From the asymptotic behavior of these functions, we obtain a transition point that indicates whether a network is operating in an efficient noise-limited regime or in an inefficient interference-limited regime for a given resource budget. For networks operating in the inefficient regime, we propose a novel partial resource muting scheme to improve the efficiency of the resource utilization. The framework is very general. It can be applied not only to the downlink of 4G networks, but also to 5G networks equipped with flexible duplex mechanisms. Numerical results show significant performance gains of the proposed scheme compared to the solution to the max-min utility optimization problem with full frequency reuse.
