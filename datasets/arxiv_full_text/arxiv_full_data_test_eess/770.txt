{"title": "Power Distribution System Synchrophasors with Non-Gaussian Errors:  Real-World Measurements and Analysis", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This letter studies the synchrophasor measurement error of electric power distribution systems with on-line and off-line measurements using graphical and numerical tests. It demonstrates that the synchrophasor measurement error follows a non-Gaussian distribution instead of the traditionally-assumed Gaussian distribution. It suggests the need to use non-Gaussian or Gaussian mixture models to represent the synchrophasor measurement error. These models are more realistic to accurately represent the error than the traditional Gaussian model. The measurements and underlying analysis will be helpful for the understanding of distribution system measurement characteristics, and also for the modeling and simulation of distribution system applications.
