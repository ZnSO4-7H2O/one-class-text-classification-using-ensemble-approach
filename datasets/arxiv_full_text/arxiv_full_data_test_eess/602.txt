{"title": "Cognitive Radars: A Reality?", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper describes some key ideas and applications of cognitive radars, highlighting the limits and the path forward. Cognitive radars are systems based on the perception-action cycle of cognition that sense the environment, learn from it relevant information about the target and the background, then adapt the radar sensor to optimally satisfy the needs of their mission according to a desired goal. The concept of cognitive radar was introduced originally for active radar only. In this paper we describe how this paradigm can be applied also to passive radar. In particular, we describe (i) cognitive active radars that work in a spectrally dense environment and change the transmitted waveform on-the-fly to avoid interference with the primary user of the channel, such as broadcast or communication systems, (ii) cognitive active radars that adjust transmit waveform parameters to achieve a specified level of target tracking performance, and (iii) cognitive passive radars, that contrary to the active radars cannot directly change the transmitted waveforms, but can instead select the best source of opportunity to improve detection and tracking performance.
