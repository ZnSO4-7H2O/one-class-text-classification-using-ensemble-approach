{"title": "Region of Interest (ROI) Coding for Aerial Surveillance Video using AVC  & HEVC", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Aerial surveillance from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e. with moving cameras, is of growing interest for police as well as disaster area monitoring. For more detailed ground images the camera resolutions are steadily increasing. Simultaneously the amount of video data to transmit is increasing significantly, too. To reduce the amount of data, Region of Interest (ROI) coding systems were introduced which mainly encode some regions in higher quality at the cost of the remaining image regions. We employ an existing ROI coding system relying on global motion compensation to retain full image resolution over the entire image. Different ROI detectors are used to automatically classify a video image on board of the UAV in ROI and non-ROI. We propose to replace the modified Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video encoder by a modified High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoder. Without any change of the detection system itself, but by replacing the video coding back-end we are able to improve the coding efficiency by 32% on average although regular HEVC provides coding gains of 12-30% only for the same test sequences and similar PSNR compared to regular AVC coding. Since the employed ROI coding mainly relies on intra mode coding of new emerging image areas, gains of HEVC-ROI coding over AVC-ROI coding compared to regular coding of the entire frames including predictive modes (inter) depend on sequence characteristics. We present a detailed analysis of bit distribution within the frames to explain the gains. In total we can provide coding data rates of 0.7-1.0 Mbit/s for full HDTV video sequences at 30 fps at reasonable quality of more than 37 dB.
