{"title": "Non Intrusive Load Monitoring in Chaotic Switching Networks", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this work, a non intrusive load disaggregation scheme is proposed. By using a kernel based nonlinear regression strategy, the switching dynamic of an electric network, simulated as a set of RLC circuits with chaotic switching, is approximated using a time series of the total power consumption. The results suggest that the employed methodology can be useful in the design of efficient load disaggregation schemes.
