{"title": "On the non-detectability of spiked large random tensors", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper addresses the detection of a low rank high-dimensional tensor corrupted by an additive complex Gaussian noise. In the asymptotic regime where all the dimensions of the tensor converge towards $+\\infty$ at the same rate, existing results devoted to rank 1 tensors are extended. It is proved that if a certain parameter depending on the low rank tensor is below a threshold, then the null hypothesis and the presence of the low rank tensor are undistinguishable hypotheses in the sense that no test performs better than a random choice.
