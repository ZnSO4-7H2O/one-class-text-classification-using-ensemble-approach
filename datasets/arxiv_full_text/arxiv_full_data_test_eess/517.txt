{"title": "A Closed-loop controller to improve the Stability of Cascaded DC/DC  Converters", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Study of the buck converter and cascaded system considering the voltage mode controller has been done. First the small signal analysis of a buck dc/dc converter is presented and its mathematical representation has been showed. Then, the cascaded converter model regarding close loop impedances and voltage gain has been studied. The controller for this converter is proposed to stabilize the performance of the plant. The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been tested on a typical buck converter.
