{"title": "Effect of Transducer Positioning in Active Noise Control", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Research in traditional Active Noise Control(ANC) often abstracts acoustic channels with band-limited filter coefficients. This is a limitation in exploring structural and positional aspects of ANC. As a solution to this, we propose the use of room acoustic models in ANC research. As a use case, we demonstrate anti-noise source position optimization using room acoustics models in achieving better noise control. Using numerical simulations, we show that level of cancellation can be improved up to 7.34 dB. All the codes and results are available in the Github repository https://github.com/cksajil/ancram in the spirit of reproducible research.
