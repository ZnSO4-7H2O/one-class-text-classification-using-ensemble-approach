{"title": "Quadrature compressive sampling SAR imaging", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper presents a quadrature compressive sampling (QuadCS) and associated fast imaging scheme for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Different from other analog-to-information conversions (AIC), QuadCS AICs using independent spreading signals sample the SAR echoes due to different transmitted pulses. Then the resulting sensing matrix has lower correlation between any two columns than that by a fixed spreading signal, and better SAR image can be reconstructed. With proper setting of the spreading signals in QuadCS, the sensing matrix has the structures suitable for fast computation of matrix-vector multiplication operations, which leads to the fast image reconstruction. The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed using real SAR image. The reconstructed SAR images with only one-fourth of the Nyquist data achieve the image quality similar to that of the classical SAR images with Nyquist samples.
