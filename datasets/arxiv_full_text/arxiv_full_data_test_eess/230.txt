{"title": "Performance Analysis of a Scalable DC Microgrid Offering Solar Power  Based Energy Access and Efficient Control for Domestic Loads", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " DC microgrids conform to distributed control of renewable energy sources which ratifies efficacious instantaneous power sharing and sustenance of energy access among different domestic Power Management Units (PMUs) along with maintaining stability of the grid voltage. In this paper design metrics and performance evaluation of a scalable DC microgrid are documented where a look-up table of generated power of a source converter complies with the distribution of efficient power sharing phenomenon among a set of two home PMUs. The source converter is connected with a Photovoltaic panel of 300 W and uses Perturb and Observation (P&O) method for executing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). A boost average DCDC converter topology is used to enhance the voltage level of the source converter before transmission. The load converter consists of two parallely connected PMUs each of which is constructed with high switching frequency based Full Bridge (FB) converter to charge an integrated Energy Storage System (ESS). In this paper the overall system is modeled and simulated on MATLAB/Simulink platform with ESSs in the form of Lead Acid batteries connected to the load side of the FB converter circuits and these batteries yield to support marginalized power utilities. The behaviour of the system is tested in different solar insolation levels along with several battery charging levels of 12 V and 36 V to assess the power efficiency. In each testbed the efficiency is found to be more than 93% which affirm the reliability of the framework and a look-up table is generated comprising the grid and load quantities for effective control of power transmission.
