{"title": "Nonuniform Sampling for Random Signals Bandlimited in the Linear  Canonical Transform Domain", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we mainly investigate the nonuniform sampling for random signals which are bandlimited in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain. We show that the nonuniform sampling for a random signal bandlimited in the LCT domain is equal to the uniform sampling in the sense of second order statistic characters after a pre-filter in the LCT domain. Moreover, we propose an approximate recovery approach for nonuniform sampling of random signals bandlimited in the LCT domain. Furthermore, we study the mean square error of the nonuniform sampling. Finally, we do some simulations to verify the correctness of our theoretical results.
