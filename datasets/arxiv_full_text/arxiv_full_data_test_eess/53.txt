Despite its increasing popularity, mainly in wireless communications, IA lacks of explicit and straightforward design procedures. Indeed, IA design results in complex optimization tasks involving a large amount of decision variables, together with a problem of convergence of the IA solutions. In this paper the IA optimization is performed using PSO and Cooperative PSO (CPSO) more suitable for large scale optimization, a comparison between the two versions is also carried out. This approach seems to be promising.
