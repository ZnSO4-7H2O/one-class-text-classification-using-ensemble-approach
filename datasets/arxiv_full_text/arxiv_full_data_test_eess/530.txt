{"title": "Analysis of Fourier ptychographic microscopy with half of the captured  images", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Fourier ptychography microscopy (FPM) is a new computational imaging technique that can provide gigapixel images with both high resolution and a wide field of view (FOV). However, time consuming of the data-acquisition process is a critical issue. In this paper, we make an analysis on the FPM imaging system with half number of the captured images. Based on the image analysis of the conventional FPM system, we then compare the reconstructed images with different number of captured data. Simulation and experiment results show that the reconstructed image with half number captured data do not show obvious resolution degradation compared to that with all the captured data, except a contrast reduction. In particular in the case when the object is close to phase-only/amplitude only, the quality of the reconstructed image with half of the captured data is nearly as good as the one reconstructed with full data.
