The current market LiDAR systems are limited by detector sensitivity: when output power is at eye-safe levels, the range is limited. Long range operation also slows image acquisition as flight-time increases. We present an approach that combines a high sensitivity photon number resolving diode with machine learning and a micro-mechanical digital mirror device to achieve safe and fast long range 3D scanning.
