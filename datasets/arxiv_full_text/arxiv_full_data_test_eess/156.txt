{"title": "Entropy-based Generating Markov Partitions for Complex Systems", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are \\emph{a priori} unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from EEG signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.

moreover optimal partition must extract much information complex system possible must generate markov-like process. achieved satisfying practice make methodology accessible seek maximisation

apply eqs. hypothesis used shannon ref. order encode deterministic trajectory means state-space parting obtain memoryless symbolic sequence maximises need generating markov partition reason twofold. firstly generating partition unique order-q partition used generate order-. means dictionary derived order-p partition contained dictionary order- partition sq+. hence smallest dictionary/partition

using encode trajectories result bijective uncorrelated symbolic sequences constant increase word length partition order would like stress that order-q partition obtained proper maximisation possible partitions locations satisﬁes markovian property given given word length thus point represented bi-inﬁnite sequence. using partition encoding means symbolic sequence generated orbit. symbolic sequence

speciﬁcally marginal partitions constitute orthogonally intersecting straight lines two-dimensional systems planes three-dimensional systems hyperplanes higher-dimensional systems. reasons that using straight lines planes divide statespace disjoint regions discarding unequivocally state-space regions. result computation probability trajectory lying within particular region independent rest regions
