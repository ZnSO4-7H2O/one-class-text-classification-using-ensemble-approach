{"title": "Determining JPEG Image Standard Quality Factor from the Quantization  Tables", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Identifying the quality factor of JPEG images is very useful for applications in digital image forensics. Though several command-line tools exist and are used in widely used software such as \\emph{GIMP} (GNU Image Manipulation Program), the well-known image editing software, or the \\emph{ImageMagick} suite, we have found that those may provide inaccurate or even wrong results. This paper presents a simple method for determining the exact quality factor of a JPEG image from its quantization tables. The method is presented briefly and a sample program, written in Unix/Linux Shell bash language is provided.

information jpeg image file header cross-checked project database. either jpeg images compressed twice stored back uncompressed format works usually assumed quantization matrix standard ones. quantization matrices also useful information hiding. quantization matrix exploited steganography side-information recent steganalysis tailored standard quantization matrices. recent work show important quantization tables information hiding detection. similarly statistical models coefficients take account quantization tables assessed standard quantization matrices. however noticed currently tools checking whether jpeg images compressed using standard quantization matrix. even worst several tools provide inaccurate even wrong results. instance jpegsnoop returns approx quality

possible quality factor recall relation quality factor ensuing quantization matrices note clarity method described quantization luminance channel since works exactly chrominance. denotes rounding variable elements default quantization matrices provided parameter given usual case quality factor otherwise parameter given allows increase quantization steps much faster pace decreases. note relation valid quantity factor greater considered case since jpeg images quality factor smaller extremely rare. however simple adaptation greater straightforward. already stated section first step
