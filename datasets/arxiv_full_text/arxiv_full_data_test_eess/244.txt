{"title": "Simple sampling clock synchronisation scheme for reduced-guard-interval  coherent optical OFDM systems", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " A simple data-aided scheme for sampling clock synchronisation in reduced-guard-interval coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (RGI-CO-OFDM) systems is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the sampling clock offset (SCO) is estimated by using the training symbols reserved for channel estimation, thus avoiding extra training overhead. The SCO is then compensated by resampling, using a time-domain interpolation filter. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by means of numerical simulations in a 32-Gbaud 16-QAM dual-polarisation RGI-CO-OFDM system.
