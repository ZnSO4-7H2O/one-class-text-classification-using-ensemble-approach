{"title": "Partial Template Based Receiver in Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband  Communication Systems", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " For high speed ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems, the multipath interference exhibits a primary obstacle to improve transmission performance. In order to enhance the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in the receiver, a partial template receiver is proposed in this paper. Instead of using the conventional template, the model in this paper adopts a partial template to demodulate signals. To analyze the performance of the proposed receiver, bit error rate (BER) formulation of IR-UWB systems in the presence of multipath interference, multiuser interference and addictive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is derived in IEEE 802.15.4a channel models. Simulation results show that, compared with the conventional correlation receiver, the proposed receiver can achieve a better BER performance for high Eb/N0, which falls in the conventional used Eb/N0 range.
