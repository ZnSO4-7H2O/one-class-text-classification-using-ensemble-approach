{"title": "Comparison of threshold-based algorithms for sparse signal recovery", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Intensively growing approach in signal processing and acquisition, the Compressive Sensing approach, allows sparse signals to be recovered from small number of randomly acquired signal coefficients. This paper analyses some of the commonly used threshold-based algorithms for sparse signal reconstruction. Signals satisfy the conditions required by the Compressive Sensing theory. The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Iterative Hard Thresholding and Single Iteration Reconstruction algorithms are observed. Comparison in terms of reconstruction error and execution time is performed within the experimental part of the paper.
