{"title": "High efficiency compression for object detection", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Image and video compression has traditionally been tailored to human vision. However, modern applications such as visual analytics and surveillance rely on computers seeing and analyzing the images before (or instead of) humans. For these applications, it is important to adjust compression to computer vision. In this paper we present a bit allocation and rate control strategy that is tailored to object detection. Using the initial convolutional layers of a state-of-the-art object detector, we create an importance map that can guide bit allocation to areas that are important for object detection. The proposed method enables bit rate savings of 7% or more compared to default HEVC, at the equivalent object detection rate.
