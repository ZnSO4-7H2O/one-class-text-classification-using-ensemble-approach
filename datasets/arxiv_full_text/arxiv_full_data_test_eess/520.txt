{"title": "A Novel Hybrid Islanding Detection Method for Inverter-based DG", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " A novel method for achieving a better performance using the combination of the available passive and active methods has been proposed. The algorithm detects the islanding in proper time by using harmonic detection, the average rate of change of voltage and shifting power generation. Harmonic detection in this method decreases process time and also differentiates between islanding and other power systems events. For harmonic detection, extended Kalman filter has been used. Besides, the reliability of the method increases using the average rate of change of the voltage. The proposed method uses a strategy for decreasing the non-detection zone. In this strategy, minimum and maximum average rates of change of voltage limits are defined to improve the security of the system. Therefore, three main specifications of a proper method, reliability, security and time of process are achievable by the combination of these passive and active methods. By applying different power system events under different power conditions, the proposed method has been verified in Simulink software.
