This paper proposes a novel method to capture the spectral and light field information simultaneously. By using a delicately designed chromatic aberration enlarged camera, the spectral-varying slices at different depths of the scene can be easily captured. Afterwards, the multispectral focal stack, which is composed of a stack of multispectral slice images focusing on different depths, can be recovered from the spectral-varying slices by using a Local Linear Transformation (LLT) based algorithm. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
