{"title": "Design of a sustainable pre-polarizing magnetic resonance imaging system  for infant hydrocephalus", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The need for affordable and appropriate medical technologies for developing countries continue to rise as challenges such as inadequate energy supply, limited technical expertise and poor infrastructure persists. Low-field MRI is a technology that can be tailored to meet specific imaging needs within such countries. Its low power requirements and the possibility of operating in minimally shielded or unshielded environments make it especially attractive. Although the technology has been widely demonstrated over several decades, it is yet to be shown that it can be diagnostic and improve patient outcomes in clinical applications. We here demonstrate the robustness of pre-polarizing MRI (PMRI) technology for assembly and deployment in developing countries for the specific application to infant hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus treatment planning and management requires modest spatial resolution, and only that the brain can be distinguished from fluid - tissue contrast detail within the brain parenchyma is not essential. We constructed an internally shielded PMRI system based on the Lee-Whiting coil system with a 22 cm diameter of spherical volume. In an unshielded room, projection phantom images were acquired at 113 kHz with in-plane resolution of 3 mm x 3 mm, by introducing gradient fields of sufficient magnitude to dominate the 5000ppm inhomogeneity of the readout field. The low cost, straightforward assembly, deployment potential, and maintenance requirements demonstrate the suitability of our PMRI system for developing countries. Further improvement in the image spatial resolution and contrast of low-field MRI will broaden its potential clinical utility beyond hydrocephalus.
