The modelling work includes handset and Access Point antenna arrays, where specific millimeter-wave challenges are addressed. In power amplifier related analysis, statistical and behavioural modelling approaches are discussed. Phase Noise, regarded as a main impairment in millimeter-wave, is captured under two models and some analysis into to the impact of phase noise is also provided.
