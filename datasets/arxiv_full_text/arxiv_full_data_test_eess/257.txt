{"title": "Performance Analysis of UWB Based Wireless Sensor Networks in Indoor  Office LOS Environment", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " With the fast development of wireless sensor networks (WSN), more attentions are paid to high data rate transmission of WSN, and hence, in IEEE 802.15.4a standard, ultra-wideband (UWB) is introduced as one of the physical layer technique to support high transmission data rate and precisie locationing applications. In order to analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance of UWB based WSN, a system model considering intra-symbol interference (IASI), inter-symbol interference (ISI), multiuser interference (MUI) and addictive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is proposed in this paper, and then verified using simulation results. Moreover, the pulse waveforms complying with the spectrum requirement of IEEE 802.15.4a standard are given, and based on such obtained pulses, the effect of transmission data rate and user number is also shown. Results show that with the increase of SNR, the intra-symbol interference will decrease the system performance significantly, and system performance can be improve by using pulse waveforms with little intra-symbol interference.
