{"title": "Tree based classification of tabla strokes", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The paper attempts to validate the effectiveness of tree classifiers to classify tabla strokes especially the ones which are overlapping in nature. It uses decision tree, ID3 and random forest as classifiers. A custom made data sets of 650 samples of 13 different tabla strokes were used for experimental purpose. 31 different features with their mean and variances were extracted for classification. Three data sets consisting of 21361, 18802 and 19543 instances respectively were used for the purpose. Validation has been done using measures like ROC curve and accuracy. The experimental results showed that all the classifiers showing excellent results with random forest outperforming the other two. The effectiveness of random forest in classifying strokes which are overlapping in nature is done by comparing the known results of that with multi-layer perceptron.

real task classification find relationship features associated classes. various categories classification include linear classifiers support vector machines quadratic classifiers kernel estimation decision trees neural networks. among these tree based classifiers commonly used developing prediction algorithms target variable. classifiers construct root node population branches comprise internal

percussion instruments like pakhwaj mridangam dholak dholki. refined tonal quality sophistication tabla came forefront solo performing instrument leaving behind instruments. abla combination drums namely bayaan dayaan shown figure produces strokes called bols. bols mnemonic syllables produced using different techniques based diverse musical traditions. table gives list basic strokes played dayaan bayaan individually collectively transcription tabla strokes said challenging task computer scientists. unlike western rhythmic instruments characteristics strokes easily detected tabla strokes hard detect. tabla produces long resonant bols overlap successive bols. also bols used represent rhythmic strokes depend specific context vary accordingly. exist bols different sound similar. example bols played subtle changes fingering style hardly identified correctly even experienced listeners. decision tree algorithms flexible powerful offer high performance prediction problems. without pre-defined assumption controlled parameters algorithms capable fitting large amount data. principle decision tree algorithms categorize data considering attribute values. parent node tree represents
