{"title": "A Semi-Automated Technique for Internal Jugular Vein Segmentation in  Ultrasound Images Using Active Contours", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The assessment of the blood volume is crucial for the management of many acute and chronic diseases. Recent studies have shown that circulating blood volume correlates with the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular vein (IJV) estimated from ultrasound imagery. In this paper, a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm is proposed using a combination of region growing and active contour techniques to provide a fast and accurate segmentation of IJV ultrasound videos. The algorithm is applied to track and segment the IJV across a range of image qualities, shapes, and temporal variation. The experimental results show that the algorithm performs well compared to expert manual segmentation and outperforms several published algorithms incorporating speckle tracking.
