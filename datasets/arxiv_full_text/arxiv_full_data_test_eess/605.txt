{"title": "SpeechPy - A Library for Speech Processing and Recognition", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " SpeechPy is an open source Python package that contains speech preprocessing techniques, speech features, and important post-processing operations. It provides most frequent used speech features including MFCCs and filterbank energies alongside with the log-energy of filter-banks. The aim of the package is to provide researchers with a simple tool for speech feature extraction and processing purposes in applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Verification.

signal speech classiﬁcation purposes high dimensionality signal less informative compared extracted higher level features. feature extraction comes rescue turning high dimensional signal lower

multimodal signals demonstrated promising results speech features categorized general types acoustic linguistic features. former mainly related non-verbal sounds later associated systems verbal part

availability free software speech recognition voicebox softwares matlab-based limits reproducibility commercial issues. another great package pyaudioanalysis comprehensive package developed python. however issue pyaudioanalysis complexity verbose extracting simple features also lacks important preprocessing post-processing operations current version. considering recent advent deep learning importance accurate speech feature extraction motivations behind speechpy package speechpy developed satisfy aforementioned needs. contains important preprocessing post-processing operations selection frequently used speech features. package free released open source software. continuous integration using instant error check validity changes deployed speechpy. moreover prior latest ofﬁcial release speechpy package successfully utilized research purposes speechpy developed using python language interface backed well. empirical study demonstrated python scripting language effective productive conventional languages programming problems memory consumption often better java much worse chose python simplicity popularity. third-party libraries avoided except numpy scipy handling data numeric computations. user even need manipulate internal package structure objectoriented programming mostly used package development provides easier interface user sacriﬁce simplicity code. however internal
