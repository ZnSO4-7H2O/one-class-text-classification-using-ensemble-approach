list hardware; driver; communication channels; messages; modes; controllers; ﬁles standard midi; visual control among things. note concerned midi protocol standard midi files contain level things called events. event consists components midi time midi message. time/message pairs follow midi illustrated fig. time value measurement time wait playing next message stream midi data. method specifying time called delta time speciﬁes duration events midi commands data distinguished according signiﬁcant byte. zero byte data byte otherwise byte command byte. midi messages sent sequence bytes. ﬁrst byte command byte often followed data bytes additional parameters. command byte determines type command. number data bytes follow depend type message. instance following commands diﬀerent number data bytes main complaying single musical note. least playing modes namely mono poly. monophonic start note-on command implies termination previous note. polyphonic multiple notes sounding once notes reach decay envelope explicit note-oﬀ commands received. main messages note note messages. note message sent performer hits music keyboard. contains parameters specify pitch note well velocity synthesizer receives message starts playing note correct pitch force level. note message received corresponding note switched synthesizer. channels numbered actual corresponding binary encoding midi commands decomposed command type nibble channel number nibble velocity value normally goes covering range practically inaudible note maximum note level. basically corresponds scale nuances found music notation follows. figure shows diﬀerent standard note level. beginning quite common following commands another command used beginning encompasses deﬁnition metronome number microseconds quarter note. instance bpm; bpm. track event optional. included exact ending point speciﬁed track exact length deﬁned necessary tracks looped concatenated. looking inside midi suggest example initial data monophonic midi reading separating {time/message} pairs black characters delta time information blue characters messages. blue boldface type part command ordinary blue characters data associated previous command. final remark many times command note-oﬀ replaced command equivalent. time value expressed terms number ticks. however hex-value record time value obtained converting number ticks. special format used referred variable length values details). notice time values sometime bytes length sometimes byte length. using byte delta time implies longer time value. example data simple monophonic midi look header midi understand units mean. example time units ticks quarter note quarter note duration half-note eighth-note duration particularly interested midi perspective musicians take straightforward example. easier build midi coding generating corresponding notegram excerpt score displayed fig. list midi events midi message used specify instrument program change message command byte= cccc data byte =xxx xxxx piano bass drum channels respectively. illustrative example midi sequence shown sequel. first send program changes specify instruments channel. fig. score example three instruments. suppose piano bass drum respectively channels midi message sequence following. brief explanatory report revises representations discrete mathematical structures used music. intended midi beginners. motivation writing came diﬃculty ﬁnding simple text allows understanding midi ﬁles. presentation tries throw light midi built musical score. also allows understand commands generated build corresponding score. fig. provides insight time events deﬁned. hoped note help ordinary users deal digital music. ﬁnal remark when trying learn midi internet reader could feel hardship clarity subject. nevertheless reading paper trivial matter. mind opens idea never returns original size", "year": "2017"}
