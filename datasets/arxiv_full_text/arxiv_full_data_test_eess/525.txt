{"title": "A new optimization problem in FSO communication system", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " According to the physical phenomena of atmospheric channels and wave propagation, performance of wireless communication systems can be optimized by simply adjusting its parameters. This way is more economically favorable than consuming power or using processing techniques. In this paper for the first time an optimization problem is developed on the performance of free-space optical multi-input multi-output (FSO-MIMO) communication system. Also it is the first time that the optimization of FSO is developed under saturated atmospheric turbulences. In order to get closer to the actual results, the effect of pointing error is taken into considerations. Assuming MPSK, DPSK modulation schemes, new closed-form expressions are derived for Bit Error Rate (BER) of the proposed structure. Furthermore, an optimization is developed taking into account the beam width as the variable parameter, and BER as the objective function, there is no constraint in this system. The obtained results can be a useful outcome for FSO-MIMO system designers in order to limit effects of pointing error as well as atmospheric turbulences and thus achieves optimum performance.
