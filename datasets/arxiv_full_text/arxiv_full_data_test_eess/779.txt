{"title": "Music Style Transfer: A Position Paper", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Led by the success of neural style transfer on visual arts, there has been a rising trend very recently in the effort of music style transfer. However, \"music style\" is not yet a well-defined concept from a scientific point of view. The difficulty lies in the intrinsic multi-level and multi-modal character of music representation (which is very different from image representation). As a result, depending on their interpretation of \"music style\", current studies under the category of \"music style transfer\", are actually solving completely different problems that belong to a variety of sub-fields of Computer Music. Also, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which aims at dealing with all levels of music representation at once by directly adopting the method of image style transfer, leads to poor results. Thus, we vitally propose a more scientifically-viable definition of music style transfer by breaking it down into precise concepts of timbre style transfer, performance style transfer and composition style transfer, as well as to connect different aspects of music style transfer with existing well-established sub-fields of computer music studies. In addition, we discuss the current limitations of music style modeling and its future directions by drawing spirit from some deep generative models, especially the ones using unsupervised learning and disentanglement techniques.

vowel-to-pitch mapping algorithm generate sequence notes crafting music still mainstream algorithmic composition general automated music generation become popular nowadays development modern computers. hand fast cpus offer dramatic speedup experimentations people test different ideas much rapidly. addition various computer-music programming languages invented since late boosted efﬁciency music creation programming. hand advanced computational models data-driven algorithms empowered computers generate human-like music inheriting certain statistics styles training sets. recently breakthroughs artiﬁcial neural networks deep generative models become leading techniques automated music generation examples mimicking j.s. bach alone seen bachbot deepbach cnnbach etc. generate convincing results. despite promising progress people still struggle generate natural creative music automation. general algorithms weak constraints often random rarely make human-like music though many works interesting creative contemporary perspective. hand algorithms strong constraints mostly lack exploration dynamic easily sensed genuinely creative works. music style transfer importance challenges image style transfer techniques inspired hope solve paradox above. separating recombining music contents music styles different pieces possible generate music creative human-like. words still favorite data-driven algorithms twist constraints optimizations general applying separately different aspects music. effort named music style transfer. however severe problem music style fuzzy term literally refer aspect music ranging highlevel compositional features low-level acoustic features ambiguity mainly intrinsic multi-level multi-modal character music representation music read listened performed depends whether relying score sound relationship music notation actual sound similar text speech. score serves symbolic highly-abstract visual representation efﬁciently record communicate music ideas whereas sound continuous concrete signal representations encode details hear. therefore picture representations different levels score sound bottom middle people often insert intermediate representation performance control. reasons twofold. first musical semantics expression rely heavily performance control funeral hymn sound really happy simply tripling tempo. second performance control many instruments easily parameterized therefore machine friendly. note different levels representation solely mutually exclusive multi-level property offers useful tool better understand essence music content style. fully comprehend different aspects music style transfer shall ﬁrst investigate multi-level property music representation in-depth. score representation score representation exists many forms including sheet music notation lead sheet chord chart numbered musical notation. highly symbolic encode character score representation encoded features mostly discrete measurement scale. take western music notation example. note onset ratio variable lies integer multiples certain time unit pitch interval variable whose corresponding fundamental frequency always lies discrete sequence. dynamics ordinal variable usually ranging fff. many symbols nominal variables chord types repeat signs. characters bring challenge generative models since discrete optimization general difﬁcult mixed scale makes numerical operations impossible. performance control encodes interpretation corresponding score rely performer turns score performance motions. commonly used control representation midi piano roll note encoded pitch dynamics onset duration. also number controllers pedal pitch bend performance nuances. speciﬁc pitches integers semitones dynamics integers velocities units ranging timings ﬂoating point numbers seconds. compared score representation character performance control enriched detailed timing dynamics information less determined musical expression performance. hand structural information phrase repetition chord progression ﬂattened become implicit translation score performance control. note performance control largely independent actual instrument; ﬁnal music sound still considered middle-level abstraction. sound representation sound concrete signal representation seen acoustic realization corresponding performance control certain instrument. commonly used formats sound representation waveform spectrogram character sound representation purely continuous rich acoustic details timbre articulation nuances available levels representation. expense acoustic details symbolic abstractions together precise performance control information become explicit hidden audio. representation content style table shows summary different music representations. important notice multi-level architecture actually already implied essence music content music style i.e. music content information extracted abstraction music style information enriched interpretation realization thus complete end-to-end system music style transfer least fulﬁll three requirements crossmodal ﬂexible deal different measurement scales automatically extract performance control score information sound input freely manipulate music representations level. however accept fact systems exist emerge near future. second requirement alone remains open problem main focus whole ﬁeld music information retrieval many years. therefore beneﬁcial ﬁrst solve style transfer level music representation gradually integrate different components system. hasty attempt end-to-end music style transfer system directly adopting algorithms image style transfer would lead results sound like casual remix different pieces music. figure spectrogram example horizontal axis represents time vertical axis represents frequency color represents energy distribution different frequencies. present precise deﬁnitions music style transfer level representation bottom-up order. timbre style transfer sound performance style transfer performance control composition style transfer score. also include brief overview related work connect existing sub-ﬁelds computer music. deﬁnition timbre style transfer applies sound representation. means alter timbre information meaningful preserving hidden content performance control. successful timbre style transfer would allow reproduce trumpet performance ﬂute musical expression. timbre style transfer closely related sound synthesis especially studies aiming synthesize different sound acoustic instruments. difference timbre style transfer requires disentanglement timbre performance control implies room create timbre combination different ones. recent pioneer studies timbre style transfer google’s wavenet autoencoders stanford’s audio spectrograms neural style transfer system former built autoencoder waveform using wavenet bottleneck hidden layer therefore considered timbre representation used create timbre linear interpolation. latter treated audio spectrograms images applied image style transfer additional carefully designed constraints temporal frequency energy envelopes. shall also limitations. works disentanglement timbre performance control information successful especially length processed audio unit long. also synthesis perspective sound quality synthesized instruments still state-of-art learning-based synthesis techniques worth investigation. side note visualsoundtrack named style transfer actually synthesis system. requires human inputs pitch disentanglement involved. deﬁnition performance style transfer applies performance control representation. means alter control information meaningful preserving implicit score content. successful performance style transfer would allow transfer louis armstrong’s interpretation summertime miles davis. closely related expressive performance rendering studies convert static scores human-like expressive performances

work performance style transfer though performer identiﬁcation studied decade. close attempt recent duet interaction system generate expressive accompaniment based performance style solo requires pre-deﬁned score cancreate performance styles. side note work named neural translation musical style actually expressive performance rendering system focuses dynamic generation given score input. thus performance style transfer remains brand-new ﬁeld worth exploring. composition style transfer many forms score room abstraction. take western music notation example identiﬁable score feature general melody contour sometimes structural functions harmony especially case tonal music. successful composition style transfer would allow create variation improvisation re-harmonization rearrangement piece music. representative masterpiece twelve variations vous dirai-je maman mozart. take ﬁrst variation example mostly preserved melody contour chord progression theme altered rhythm texture large extent. recent high-quality pieces include improvisation mary little lamb korean style carmen overture chinese style mozart sonata. composition style transfer closely related stylistic automatic composition traced back david cope difference topics composition style transfer requires disentanglement different score features implies room create types/idioms score features combination different ones. pioneer studies automatic composition style transfer include ﬁrst deal monophonic composition last deals polyphonic composition. work builds pitch rhythm models separately different music genres create melodies combination pitch model genre rhythm model another genre. works rely power explicit rules modify melody merge different chord progressions respectively. work enforces certain music structures considering additional template-matching constraints optimization procedure. demo pieces created early studies still quite immature especially compared pieces made humans. major problem actually transfer composition style model ﬁrst place. current composition models still lack capacity representation music structure hidden grammar chord progressions. note successful cases automatic stylistic composition related bach least non-experts structure bach’s compositions rather local easy perceive compared many composers. unlikely coincidence worth attention future studies. shall model styles composition performance timbre better transfer effect? current studies following three approaches model music styles inherit style implicitly training simple style embedding generation apply style-related constraints generation. words require manuallydeﬁned style representation style label generation. stated earlier style transfer calls disentanglement content style. would make sense learn disentanglement rather crafting hand. ﬁeld deep generative modeling learning disentanglement already attracted vast amount attention image generation tasks adversarial training achieved disentanglement latent factors applied within generative adversarial network variational auto-encoder framework. pioneering study applied framework algorithmic composition though convincing results still bounded length bars conceivable apply style transfer task modiﬁcation. upon successful disentanglement style considered latent factors style transfer accomplished steps. ﬁrst disentangle style code hidden representation generates music second plug code appropriate sequence generation framework preserves factors. creative human-like music. questions like what miles davis wrote twelve variations vous dirai-je maman’ performed ﬂute would purely imaginary. order generate meaningful results future works aware multi-level multi-modal music representation clear whether focus timbre style transfer performance style transfer composition style transfer. also automatic disentanglement content style representation high-quality style transfer algorithms worth effort whole ﬁeld believe
