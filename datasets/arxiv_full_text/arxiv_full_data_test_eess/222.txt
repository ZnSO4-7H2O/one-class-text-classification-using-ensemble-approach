{"title": "Image Inpainting by Hyperbolic Selection of Pixels for Two Dimensional  Bicubic Interpolations", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Image inpainting is a restoration process which has numerous applications. Restoring of scanned old images with scratches, or removing objects in images are some of inpainting applications. Different approaches have been used for implementation of inpainting algorithms. Interpolation approaches only consider one direction for this purpose. In this paper we present a new perspective to image inpainting. We consider multiple directions and apply both one-dimensional and two-dimensional bicubic interpolations. Neighboring pixels are selected in a hyperbolic formation to better preserve corner pixels. We compare our work with recent inpainting approaches to show our superior results.
