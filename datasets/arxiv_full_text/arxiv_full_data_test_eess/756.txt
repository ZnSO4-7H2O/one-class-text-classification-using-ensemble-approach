{"title": "ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG2014/ m34661: Quality Assessment of High  Dynamic Range (HDR) Video Content Using Existing Full-Reference Metrics", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The main focus of this document is to evaluate the performance of the existing LDR and HDR metrics on HDR video content which in turn will allow for a better understanding of how well each of these metrics work and if they can be applied in capturing, compressing, transmitting process of HDR data. To this end a series of subjective tests is performed to evaluate the quality of DML-HDR video database [1], when several different representing types of artifacts are present using a HDR display. Then, the correlation between the results from the existing LDR and HDR quality metrics and those from subjective tests is measured to determine the most effective exiting quality metric for HDR.
