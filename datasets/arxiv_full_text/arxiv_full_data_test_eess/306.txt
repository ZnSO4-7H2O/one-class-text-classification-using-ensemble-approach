{"title": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Aided Communications: Joint Transmit Power and  Trajectory Optimization", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This letter investigates the transmit power and trajectory optimization problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided networks. Different from majority of the existing studies with fixed communication infrastructure, a dynamic scenario is considered where a flying UAV provides wireless services for multiple ground nodes simultaneously. To fully exploit the controllable channel variations provided by the UAV's mobility, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum average throughput within a given time length. For the formulated non-convex optimization with power budget and trajectory constraints, this letter presents an efficient joint transmit power and trajectory optimization algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and reveal that the optimized transmit power shows a water-filling characteristic in spatial domain.
