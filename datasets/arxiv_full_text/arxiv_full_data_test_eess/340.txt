{"title": "Zero-Delay Gaussian Joint Source-Channel Coding for the Interference  Channel", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " This paper studies zero-delay joint source channel coding (JSCC) for transmission of correlated Gaussian sources over a Gaussian interference channel (GIC). We propose to adopt delay-free hybrid digital and analog (HDA) scheme, which is, transmitting the superposition of scaled source and its quantized version after applying scalar quantization to the source at each transmitter. At the corresponding receiver, two kinds of estimators are presented. It is shown that both the schemes, when optimized, beat the uncoded transmission if the channel signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR) is higher than a threshold value for different correlation coefficients and interference values.
