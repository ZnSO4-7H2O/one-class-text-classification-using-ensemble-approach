{"title": "A New Peak Detection Method for Single or Three-Phase Unbalanced  Sinusoidal Signals", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, a fast amplitude detection method for the single or three-phase unbalanced sinusoidal is reported. The proposed method is a method of the amplitude detection for a single phase or three phase unbalanced sinusoidal signal, based on detecting of the pulse width corresponding to the peak amplitude. The detection period is the half period of the input signal. This method is independent of the three-phase signal's unbalance and phase sequence. The proposed method was verified through experiments for the single or three-phase unbalanced signals.
