{"title": "Improved Time of Arrival measurement model for non-convex optimization", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The quadratic system provided by the Time of Arrival technique can be solved analytically or by optimization algorithms. In practice, a combination of both methods is used. An important problem in quadratic optimization is the possible convergence to a local minimum, instead of the global minimum. This article presents an approach how this risk can be significantly reduced. The main idea of our approach is to transform the local minimum to a saddle point, by increasing the number of dimensions. In contrast to similar methods such as, dimension lifting does our problem remains non-convex.
