{"title": "How to interconnect for Massive MIMO Self-Calibration?", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relies on the channel reciprocity to obtain the downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) with the acquired uplink (UL) CSI at the base station (BS). However, the mismatches in the radio frequency (RF) analog circuits at different antennas at the BS break the end-to-end UL and DL channel reciprocity. To restore the channel reciprocity, it is necessary to calibrate all the antennas at the BS. This paper addresses the interconnection strategy for the internal self-calibration at the BS where different antennas are interconnected via hardware transmission lines. Specifically, the paper reveals the optimality of the star interconnection and the daisy chain interconnection respectively. From the results, we see the star interconnection is the optimal interconnection strategy when the BS are given the same number of measurements. On the other hand, the daisy chain interconnection outperforms the star interconnection when the same amount of time resources are consumed. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical analyses.
