{"title": "An Analysis on Caching Placement for Millimeter/Micro Wave Hybrid  Networks", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we consider a hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) and micro wave ($\\mu$Wave) network from the perspective of \\emph{wireless caching} and study the optimal probabilistic content/file caching placement at desirable base stations (BSs) using a stochastic geometric framework. Considering the average success probability (ASP) of file delivery as the performance metric, we derive expressions for the association probability of the typical user to the mmWave and $\\mu$Wave networks. Accordingly, we provide an upper bound for the ASP of file delivery and formulate the content caching placement scheme as an optimization problem with respect to caching probabilities, that jointly optimizes the ASP of file delivery considering both content placement and delivery phases. In particular, we consider the caching placement strategy under both noise-limited and interference-limited environments. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed caching schemes under essential factors, such as blockages in the mmWave network, cluster radius, BS density, and path loss and compare it with uniform caching placement, caching $M$ most popular contents, and random caching placement. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed caching scheme over others, albeit certain trade-offs.
