{"title": "Cellular UAV-to-X Communications: Design and Optimization for Multi-UAV  Networks", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, we consider a single-cell cellular network with a number of cellular users (CUs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in which multiple UAVs upload their collected data to the base station (BS). Two transmission modes are considered to support the multi-UAV communications, i.e., UAV-to-infrastructure (U2I) and UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communications. Specifically, the UAV with a high signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the U2I link uploads its collected data directly to the BS through U2I communication, while the UAV with a low SNR for the U2I link can transmit data to a nearby UAV through underlaying U2U communication for the sake of quality of service. We first propose a cooperative UAV sense-and-send protocol to enable the UAV-to-X communications, and then formulate the subchannel allocation and UAV speed optimization problem to maximize the uplink sum-rate. To solve this NP-hard problem efficiently, we decouple it into three sub-problems: U2I and cellular user (CU) subchannel allocation, U2U subchannel allocation, and UAV speed optimization. An iterative subchannel allocation and speed optimization algorithm (ISASOA) is proposed to solve these sub-problems jointly. Simulation results show that the proposed ISASOA can upload 10\\% more data than the greedy algorithm.
