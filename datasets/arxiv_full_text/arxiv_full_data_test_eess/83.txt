{"title": "Compressed Sensing, ASBSR-method of image sampling and reconstruction  and the problem of digital image acquisition with the lowest possible  sampling rate", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The problem of minimization of the number of measurements needed for digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy is addressed. Basics of the sampling theory are outlined to show that the lower bound of signal sampling rate sufficient for signal reconstruction with a given accuracy is equal to the spectrum sparsity of the signal sparse approximation that has this accuracy. It is revealed that the compressed sensing approach, which was advanced as a solution to the sampling rate minimization problem, is far from reaching the sampling rate theoretical minimum. Potentials and limitations of compressed sensing are demystified using a simple and intutive model, A method of image Arbitrary Sampling and Bounded Spectrum Reconstruction (ASBSR-method) is described that allows to draw near the image sampling rate theoretical minimum. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verification of the ASBSR-method and its possible applicability extensions to solving various underdetermined inverse problems such as color image demosaicing, image in-painting, image reconstruction from their sparsely sampled or decimated projections, image reconstruction from the modulus of its Fourier spectrum, and image reconstruction from its sparse samples in Fourier domain ", "text": "problem minimization number measurements needed digital image acquisition reconstruction given accuracy addressed. basics sampling theory outlined show lower bound signal sampling rate sufficient signal reconstruction given accuracy equal spectrum sparsity signal sparse approximation accuracy. revealed compressed sensing approach advanced solution sampling rate minimization problem reaching sampling rate theoretical minimum. potentials limitations compressed sensing demystified using simple intutive model method image arbitrary sampling bounded spectrum reconstruction described allows draw near image sampling rate theoretical minimum. presented discussed also results experimental verification asbsr-method possible applicability extensions solving various underdetermined inverse problems color image demosaicing image in-painting image reconstruction sparsely sampled decimated projections image reconstruction modulus fourier spectrum image reconstruction sparse samples fourier domain. minimal sampling rate secures signal reconstruction equal signal energy outside bandwidth corresponding fourier spectra centered spectra components aerialphoto barbara bloodvessels mushrooms nish pirat rome westconcord testcs. highlighted largest spectral components sufficient image reconstruction jpeg encoding. figure theoretical experimental relationships signal sparsity sampling redundancy required compressed sensing approach. sampling redundancies curves signal reconstruction possible otherwise not. figure bottom test signal composed sinusoidal components;
