{"title": "Reconfigurable high Gain split Ring Resonator Microstrip Patch Antenna", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " In this paper, reconfigurable high gain split ring resonator microstrip patch antenna is designed and analysed. The aim to design such type antenna is to achieve multiband application which is the demand of current technology in frequency reconfiguration within single antenna. Here microstrip patch antenna with rectangle shape of patch with patch dimension 11.6*11.6 mm2 is analysed. The proposed design is tuned with two bands in the frequency range of 5-9 GHz depending on the geometric specification of antenna and the location of feed which can be used for multiband applications. Design results of VSWR, return loss (S11), bandwidth and gain are shown in this paper which is obtained by high frequency structure simulator (HFSS) which is used for simulating microwave passive components.
