{"title": "Noise Cancellation in Cognitive Radio Systems: A Performance Comparison  of Evolutionary Algorithms", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Noise cancellation is one of the important signal processing functions of any communication system, as noise affects data integrity. In existing systems, traditional filters are used to cancel the noise from the received signals. These filters use fixed hardware which is capable of filtering specific frequency or a range of frequencies. However, next generation communication technologies, such as cognitive radio, will require the use of adaptive filters that can dynamically reconfigure their filtering parameters for any frequency. To this end, a few noise cancellation techniques have been proposed, including least mean squares (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms are susceptible to non-linear noise and fail to locate the global optimum solution for de-noising. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of two global search optimization based algorithms, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization in performing noise cancellation in cognitive radio systems. These algorithms are implemented and their performances are compared to that of LMS using bit error rate and mean square error as performance evaluation metrics. Simulations are performed with additive white Gaussian noise and random nonlinear noise. Results indicate that GA and PSO perform better than LMS for the case of AWGN corrupted signal but for non-linear random noise PSO outperforms the other two algorithms.
