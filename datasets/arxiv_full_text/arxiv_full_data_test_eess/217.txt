{"title": "Polyp detection inside the capsule endoscopy: an approach for power  consumption reduction", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Capsule endoscopy is a novel and non-invasive method for diagnosis, which assists gastroenterologists to monitor the digestive track. Although this new technology has many advantages over the conventional endoscopy, there are weaknesses that limits the usage of this technology. Some weaknesses are due to using small-size batteries. Radio transmitter consumes the largest portion of energy; consequently, a simple way to reduce the power consumption is to reduce the data to be transmitted. Many works are proposed to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted consist of specific compression methods and reduction in video resolution and frame rate. We proposed a system inside the capsule for detecting informative frames and sending these frames instead of several non-informative frames. In this work, we specifically focused on hardware friendly algorithm (with capability of parallelism and pipeline) for implementation of polyp detection. Two features of positive contrast and customized edges of polyps are exploited to define whether the frame consists of polyp or not. The proposed method is devoid of complex and iterative structure to save power and reduce the response time. Experimental results indicate acceptable rate of detection of our work.
