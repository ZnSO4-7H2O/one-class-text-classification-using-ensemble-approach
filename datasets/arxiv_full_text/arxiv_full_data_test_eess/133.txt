{"title": "Structured Optical Receivers for Efficient Deep-Space Communication", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " We discuss conceptual designs for structured optical receivers that can alleviate the requirement for high peak-to-average power ratio in photon-starved optical communication. The basic idea is to transmit sequences of suitably modulated coherent light pulses whose energy can be concentrated in a single temporal bin on the receiver side through optical interference. Two examples of scalable architectures for structured receivers are presented. The first one, based on active polarization switching, maps Hadamard codewords composed from the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) constellation onto the standard pulse position modulation (PPM) format. The second receiver, using solely passive optical elements, converts phase-polarization patterns of coherent light pulses into a single pulse preserving a synchronized time of arrival. Such a conversion enables implementation of a communication protocol equivalent to the PPM scheme but with distributed optical power provided that the intersymbol guard-time exceeds the pattern length.
