{"title": "CommanderSong: A Systematic Approach for Practical Adversarial Voice  Recognition", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " The popularity of ASR (automatic speech recognition) systems, like Google Voice, Cortana, brings in security concerns, as demonstrated by recent attacks. The impacts of such threats, however, are less clear, since they are either less stealthy (producing noise-like voice commands) or requiring the physical presence of an attack device (using ultrasound). In this paper, we demonstrate that not only are more practical and surreptitious attacks feasible but they can even be automatically constructed. Specifically, we find that the voice commands can be stealthily embedded into songs, which, when played, can effectively control the target system through ASR without being noticed. For this purpose, we developed novel techniques that address a key technical challenge: integrating the commands into a song in a way that can be effectively recognized by ASR through the air, in the presence of background noise, while not being detected by a human listener. Our research shows that this can be done automatically against real world ASR applications. We also demonstrate that such CommanderSongs can be spread through Internet (e.g., YouTube) and radio, potentially affecting millions of ASR users. We further present a new mitigation technique that controls this threat.

speech recognition system major components feature extraction decoding based pre-trained models audio ampliﬁed ﬁltered acoustic features need extracted preprocessed audio signal. features contained signal change signiﬁcantly time short-time analysis used evaluate periodically. common acoustic feature extraction algorithms include mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients linear predictive coefﬁcient perceptual linear predictive etc. among them mfcc frequently used open source toolkit commercial products used analyze property acoustic features. extracted acoustic features matched pre-trained acoustic models obtain likelihood probability phonemes. hidden markov models commonly used statistical speech recognition. limited describe non-linear manifold data deep neural network-hidden markov model widely used speech recognition academic industry community since recently end-to-end deep learning becomes used speech recognition systems. applies large scale dataset uses loss function directly obtain characters rather phoneme sequence. locates alignment text transcripts input speech using allneural sequence-to-sequence neural network. traditional speech recognition systems involve many engineered processing stages supersede processing stages deep learning architecture end-toend systems always includes encoder network corresponding acoustic model decoder network corresponding language model deepspeech wavletter popular open source end-to-end speech recognition systems. nowadays people enjoying convenience integrating image speech input methods mobile devices. hence accuracy dependability image speech recognition pose critical impact security devices. intuitively adversaries compromise integrity training data either physical remote access either revising existing data inserting extra data training dataset adversaries certainly tamper dependability trained models adversaries access training data attacks still possible. recent research done deceive image recognition systems making wrong decision slightly revising input data. fundamental idea revise image slightly make look different views human machines. depending whether adversary knows algorithms parameters used recognition systems exist white black attacks. note adversary always needs able interact target system observe corresponding output input white black attacks. early researches focus revision generation digital image directly image recognition systems. state-of-the-art researches advance terms practicality printing adversarial image presenting device image recognition functionality. however success attack image recognition systems ported speech recognition systems recently complexity latter. speech time-domain continuous signal contains much features compared static images. hidden voice command launched black white attacks speech recognition systems generated obfuscated commands systems. though seminal attacking speech recognition systems also limited make practical attacks. instance large amount human effort involved feedback black approach white approach based gmm-based acoustic models replaced dnn-based ones modern speech recognition systems. recent work dolphinattack proposed completely inaudible voice attack modulating commands ultrasound carriers leveraging microphone vulnerabilities noted authors attack eliminated enhanced microphone suppress acoustic signals ultrasound carrier like iphone plus. recently adversarial attacks image classiﬁcation extensively studied results show even state-of-the-art dnn-based classiﬁer fooled small perturbations added original image producing erroneous classiﬁcation results. however impact adversarial attacks advanced speech recognition systems integrating models never systematically studied. hence paper investigated dnn-based speech recognition systems explored adversarial attacks them. researches show commands transmitted devices inaudible ultrasonic sound noises even though existing works systems seminal limited aspects. speciﬁcally ultrasonic sound defeated using low-pass ﬁlter analyzing signal frequency range noises easy noticed users. therefore research paper motivated following questions possible build practical adversarial attack systems given facts systems becoming intelligent generated adversarial samples work complicated physical environment e.g. electronic noise speaker background noise etc.? feasible generate adversarial samples difﬁcult even impossible noticed ordinary users control systems happen hidden fashion? adversarial audio samples produced possible impact large amount victims automated rather solely relying attackers play adversarial audio affecting victims nearby? below detail attack designed address questions. address idea choose songs carrier voice commands recognizable systems. reason choosing carrier least two-fold. hand enjoying songs always preferred people relax e.g. listening music station streaming music online libraries browsing youtube favorite programs. moreover entertainment restricted using radio player desktop computer more. mobile device e.g. android phone apple iphone allows people enjoy songs everywhere. hence choosing song carrier voice command automatically helps impact millions people. hand hiding desired command song also makes command much difﬁcult noticed victims long reasonably addressed. note rely lyrics song help integrate desired command. instead intend avoid songs lyrics similar desired command. instance desired command open door choosing song lyrics open actually choosing songs carrier desired commands makes even challenging. basic idea generating adversarial samples revise original song leveraging pure voice audio desired command reference. particular revision original song generate adversarial samples always trade preserving ﬁdelity original song recognizing desired commands generated sample systems. better obfuscate desired commands song paper emphasize former latter. words designed revision algorithm maximally preserve ﬁdelity original song expense losing success rate recognition desired commands. however expense compensated integrating desired command multiple times song successful recognition sufﬁces impact victims. technically order address need investigate details system. shown figure system usually composed pre-trained models acoustic model describing relationship audio signals phonetic units language model representing statistical distributions sequences words. particular given piece pure voice audio desired command carrier song feed system separately intercept intermediate results. investigating output acoustic model processing audio desired command details language model conclude information output necessary language model produce correct text desired command. design approach want ensure information small subset output acoustic model. then carefully craft output acoustic model processing original song make include information well. finally inverse acoustic model feature extraction together directly produce adversarial sample based crafted output theoretically adversarial samples generated recognized systems desired command directly input systems. since input usually form wave systems need expose apis accept input deﬁne attack wav-toapi attack. however implement practical tage aspire chain model latest released decoding models began study. manually analyzing source code kaldi completely explored kaldi processes audio decodes texts. firstly extracts acoustic features like mfcc audio. based trained probability density function acoustic model features taken input compute posterior probability matrix. p.d.f. indexed identiﬁer exactly indicates column output matrix dnn. phoneme smallest unit composing word. three states sound production phoneme series transitions among states identify phoneme. transition identiﬁer used uniquely identify state transition. therefore sequence transition-ids identify phoneme name sequence phoneme identiﬁer paper. note transition-id also mapped pdf-id. actually procedure kaldi decoding phoneme identiﬁers obtained. referring pre-obtained mapping between transition-id pdf-id phoneme identiﬁer also expressed speciﬁc sequence pdf-ids. speciﬁc sequence pdf-ids actually segment posterior probability matrix computed dnn. implies make kaldi decode speciﬁc phoneme need compute posterior probability matrix containing corresponding sequence pdf-ids. there three decoding models kaldi platform currently. aspire chain model used paper released october xvector model released october available began study. cvte mandarin model released june trained chinese attack adversarial sample played speaker interact devices air. paper deﬁne practical attack wav-airapi attack. challenge attack playing adversarial samples speaker electronic noise produced loudspeakers background noise open signiﬁcant impact recognition desired commands adversarial samples. address challenge improve approach integrating generic noise model algorithm details section implement attack addressing technical challenges minimizing perturbations song distortion original song generated adversarial sample unnoticeable possible making attack practical means commandersong played compromise devices. address ﬁrst challenge proposed pdf-id sequence matching incur minimum revision output acoustic model gradient descent generate corresponding adversarial samples section second challenge addressed introducing generic noise model simulate electronic noise background noise section elaborate details. choose open source speech recognition toolkit kaldi popularity research community. source code github obtains stars forks furthermore corpus trained kaldi fisher also used microsoft illustrate ﬁndings kaldi process piece audio several known words obtain intermediate results including posterior probability matrix computed transition-ids sequence phonemes decoded words. figure demonstrates decoded result echo contains three phonemes. boxes highlight representing corresponding phoneme phoneme identiﬁed sequence transition-ids phoneme identiﬁers. table segment relationship among phoneme pdf-id transition-id etc. referring table obtain pdf-ids sequence corresponding decoded transition-ids sequence. hence posterior probability matrix demonstrating pdf-ids sequence decoded kaldi ehb. figure demonstrates details attack approach. given original song pure voice audio desired command kaldi decode separately. analyzing decoding procedures output matrix original song figure phoneme identiﬁers desired command audio figure dnn’s output matrix containing probability pdf-id frame. suppose frames pdf-ids element column represents probability pdf-id frame frame calculate likely pdf-id highest probability frame. represents sequence likely pdf-ids original song audio simpliﬁcation represent function takes original audio input outputs sequence likely pdf-ids based dnn’s predictions. shown step figure extract sequence pdf-id command represents highest probability pdfid command frame original song decoded desired command need identify minimum modiﬁcation close speciﬁcally minimize distance related pdfid sequence deﬁne method pdf-id sequence matching algorithm. finally gradient descent iterative optimization algorithm local minimum function solve objective function. given initial point gradient descent follows direction reduces value function quickly. repeating process value starts remain stable algorithm able local minimum value. particular based objective function revise song making likely pdf-ids equal close therefore crafted audio decoded desired command. preserve ﬁdelity original song method minimize time duration revision. typically pure command voice audio generated text-to-speech engine phonemes determined phoneme identiﬁers however speed speech also determines number frames number transition-ids phoneme identiﬁer. intuitively slow speech always produces repeated frames transition-ids phoneme. typically people need frames realize phoneme speech recognition systems need three four frames interpret phoneme. hence introduce minimal revision original song analyze reduce number repeated frames phoneme obtain shorter feeding generated adversarial sample directly kaldi desired command decoded correctly. however playing sample speaker physically attack device typically cannot work. mainly noises introduced speaker environment well distortion caused receiver device. paper consider invariance background noise different environments e.g. grocery restaurant ofﬁce etc. following reasons quite noisy environment like restaurant grocery even original voice command correctly recognized devices; modeling slightly variant background noise still open research problem; based observation normal environment like home ofﬁce lobby major impacts physical attack electronic noise speaker distortion receiver devices rather background noise. hence idea build noise model considering speaker noise receiver distortion well generic background noise integrate approach section speciﬁcally carefully picked several songs played speaker quiet room. comparing recorded audio original capture noises. note playing silent audio work since electronic noise speakers depend sound different frequencies. therefore intend choose songs cover frequencies. regarding comparison pieces audio ﬁrst manually align compute difference. redesign objective function shown section present experimental results commandersong. evaluated attacks machine recognition. evaluate human comprehension conducted survey examining effects hiding desired command song. then tested transferability adversarial sample platforms checked whether commandersong spread internet radio. finally measured efﬁciency terms time generate commandersong. demos attacks uploaded website noise model quite device-dependent. since different speakers receivers introduce different noises/distortion playing receiving speciﬁc audio work devices capture noise. enhance robustness introduce random noise shown here function rand returns vector random numbers interval saved format represent evaluation results show approach make adversarial audio robust enough different speakers receivers. rand|n| pure voice audio desired

either attack integrating commands like okay google call zero nine zero echo open front door echo turn light. applied algorithm modify samples deepspeech decode target commands correctly. tested newly generated samples kaldi attack kaldi still successfully recognize them. perform attack since algorithm targeting deepspeech cannot achieve attacks air. since attack samples used launch practical adversarial attack systems want explore potential channels leveraged impact large amount victims automatically. online sharing. consider online sharing platforms like youtube spread commandersong. picked ﬁve-second adversarial sample embedded command open door applied windows movie maker software make video since youtube supports video uploading. sample repeated four times make full video

deﬁne efﬁciency ratio number frames desired command required time. table table show efﬁciency generating samples different commands. adversarial samples generated less hours simple commands like echo open front door done within half hour. however notice special words command make generation time longer. probably words commonly used training process aspire model kaldi generating enough phonemes represent words time-consuming. furthermore that songs rock category bang bang roaked usually takes longer generate adversarial samples command compared songs categories probably unstable rhythm them. questions perform analysis attacks. ways song help attack? songs carrier commands attack systems. obviously beneﬁt using song prevent listeners aware attack. also commandersong easily spread youtube radio etc. song help generate adversarial audio samples? answer question piece silent audio carrier generate commandersong test effectiveness results show work aligned ﬁndings random song serve carrier piece silent audio viewed special song. however listening sounds quite similar injected command means user easily notice adversarial samples desire. note that human subject study none participants recognized command generated commandersongs. assume phonemes even smaller units original song work together injected small perturbations form target command. verify assumption prepare song generate commandersong acs. calculate difference them attack systems using however several times testing work indicates pure perturbations injected cannot recognized target commands. recall table songs soft music category proven best carrier lowest abnormality identiﬁed participants. based ﬁndings above appears songs better aligned phonemes smaller units target command help attack. also reason cannot directly attack successfully units song combined together construct phonemes target command. impact noise generating adversarial samples? mentioned early build generic random noise model perform attack air. order understand impact noise generating adversarial samples crafted commandersong using noises different amplitude values. observed differences commandersong original song differences commandersong pure command audio success rates commandersong attack. characterize difference leverage spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient represent similarity pieces audio. spearman’s widely used represent correlation variables calculated results shown figure x-axis ﬁgure shows noise y-axis gives correlation. ﬁgure correlation commandersong original song decreases snr. means commandersong sounds less like original song amplitude value noise becomes larger. mainly original song modiﬁed commandersong robust enough introduced noise. contrary commandersong becomes similar target command audio amplitude values noise increases means commandersong sounds like target command. success rate also increases decrease snr. also note that figure shows results another perspective. suppose dark blue circle audios recognized commands systems light blue circle represent sets audio recognized commands songs human respectively. ﬁrst original song circle means neither systems human recognize command inside. attack slightly modiﬁes song open source system kaldi recognize command human cannot. noises introduced generate commandersong attacks commandersong fall light blue area step
