{"title": "Use of Two-Mode Circuitry and Optimal Energy-Efficient Power Control  Under Target Delay-Outage Constraints", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " An accurate energy efficiency analytical model based on a two-mode circuitry was recently proposed; and the model showed that the use of this circuitry can significantly improve a system's energy efficiency. In this paper, we use this analytical model to develop a new power control scheme, a scheme that is capable of allocating a minimum transmission power precisely within the delay-outage probability constraint. Precision brings substantial benefits as numerical results show that the energy efficiency using our scheme is much higher than other schemes. Results further suggest that data rate values affect energy efficiency non-uniformly, i.e., there exists a specific data rate value that achieves maximum energy efficiency.
