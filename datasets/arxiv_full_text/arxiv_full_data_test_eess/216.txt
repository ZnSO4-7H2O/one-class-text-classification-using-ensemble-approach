{"title": "Enhanced Radar Imaging Using a Complex-valued Convolutional Neural  Network", "tag": "eess", "abstract": " Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully employed to tackle several remote sensing tasks such as image classification and show better performance than previous techniques. For the radar imaging community, a natural question is: Can CNN be introduced to radar imaging and enhance its performance? The presented letter gives an affirmative answer to this question. We firstly propose a processing framework by which a complex-valued CNN (CV-CNN) is used to enhance radar imaging. Then we introduce two modifications to the CV-CNN to adapt it to radar imaging tasks. Subsequently, the method to generate training data is shown and some implementation details are presented. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out, and both results show the superiority of the proposed method on imaging quality and computational efficiency.

sensing greatly inspired research sparsity-driven radar imaging techniques typically following linear model adopted back projection algorithm fast fourier transform however either methods suffer limited resolution high side-lobes strong speckle. sparsity-driven methods impose prior constrains imaging problem transformed optimization problem although sparsity-driven methods improve imaging quality remarkably faces great challenges. firstly time-consuming achieve real time imaging. different conventional linear imaging process problem nonlinear. usually large amount iterations needed converge reasonable solution. secondly stability robustness cannot easily guaranteed. imaging quality promotion obtained solving based accurate fact model general problem solving framework. many signal processing fields e.g. image processing computer vision model also widely used. famous mostly cutting-edge performance image classification tasks recently researchers extended applied

sections introduce solutions issues. proposed processing framework shown fig. dashed solid lines show data flow training imaging/testing period respectively. imaging model contains configurations parameters imaging needs. proposed framework actually intuitive application idea supervised learning radar imaging tasks. regard imaging processor black input output block echo data formed images respectively. fig. replace conventional imaging processor cv-cnn. conventional imaging processor algorithms defined according developers’ knowledge imaging. differently here imaging processor i.e. cv-cnn self-developed training given input output examples. seen training imaging rely imaging model. therefore premise cv-cnn-enhanced radar imaging confirm imaging model. detailed discussions modifications cv-cnn method training data generation given following sections. articles talking cv-cnn recently publications rediscovered cv-cnn recognized advantages fig. shows basic neuron structure connections cv-cnn. cv-cnn. however many recent publications suggest rectified linear unit effective activation. therefore extending relu complex-valued version letter. define complex-valued relu follow seen simply apply relu real imaginary parts neuron input independently effective also critical simplify back propagation process. similarly leaky version crelu also defined according radar imaging scenarios people mainly care amplitude images. also focusing amplitude information image helps simplify later issues training data generation. consequently hope outputs cv-cnn real-valued. therefore type neuron output layer specifically defined shown fig. represent real imaginary parts respectively. suppose cost function cv-cnn defined latter. training process i.e. complex-valued back

complicated function observation angle polarization frequency explicit expression expected image function. train cv-cnn input output must exactly defined. consequently necessary simplification applied concretely ideal point scattering model used scattering confined within space. neglecting attenuation propagation phase term obtain echo turntable model cases implicit fast implementation also exist result weights fully connected layer exist explicitly also excluded training phase. comparison similar rv-cnn also designed. real imaginary parts data treated independent channels. total degree

apparently. since hard define groundtruth real targets quantitative comparisons hardly conducted. moreover quality assessment radar addition think cnn-enhanced radar imaging improved several aspects. proposed cv-cnn trained ideal point scattering assumption. indicates current cv-cnn actually point-feature-enhancement oriented. using accurate scattering models enhancement potential features target expected. also recently assume needed imaging parameters known. real world scenarios uncertainty movements parameters must estimated. whether designed achieve automatic focusing also appealing direction. novel cv-cnn-enhanced radar imaging method proposed. processing framework firstly presented. crelu activation proposed neurons output layer activation used. method generating introduced. different iterative-based imaging methods cnn-based imaging process feedforward process network. makes much faster possible achieve real time enhanced imaging. cnn-based method also robust since adaptive training data. compared real-valued counterpart cv-cnn achieves better performance less parameters. believe radar imaging benefit zhao wang yang zoubir \"the race improve radar imagery
