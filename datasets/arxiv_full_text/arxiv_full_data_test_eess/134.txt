One targets low-cost high-throughput applications and uses PAM transmission in combination with direct detection and digital reconstruction of the optical phase. This scheme allows digital compensation of chromatic dispersion and provides a significant improvement in terms of spectral efficiency, compared to conventional PAM transmission. The second scheme targets high-channel-count coherent systems with the aim of simplifying the receiver complexity by reducing the optical components count.
