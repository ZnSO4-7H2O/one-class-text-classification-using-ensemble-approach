Four different types of patch antennas and array configurations were implemented on both the transmitter and receiver sides. Extensive experiments using a linear actuator were performed and several interesting and nontrivial results were reported. It is shown that using a linearly polarized single patch antenna at the transmitter and a circularly polarized antenna array at the receiver results in the highest signal quality and system performance. Proof-of-concept experiments on human subjects further validated the suggested results. It was also shown that using the recommended antenna arrangement will boost the heart rate detection accuracy of the radar by an average of 11%.

following paragraphs effects phenomena elaborated discussed. antennas gain functions polarization mismatch factor scattering amplitude function different leading different received signal levels. also

interesting observation made comparing single antenna patches array elements. expected array antennas narrower beamwidths exploited sides reception unwanted signals would decrease resulting higher level. however measurements indicate conclusion valid. example consider third third column fig. case array antennas. peak value plot lower case sides single patch antennas result observable comparing case sides arrays versus case single patches furthermore comparing third column third fourth column fourth observed employing array antenna narrower beamwidth receiver side results higher peak power

previous case. trend true combinations. considering array either sides advisable place side. antenna polarization also shown great impact quality received signal although impact consistent. still comparing third fourth rows fig. conclude using array always results stronger signal compared using array please note real-case applications depolarization effect human body much severe aluminum foil increase polarization mismatch polarization impact become much discernible. regarding enhanced performance single lp-cp array arrangement compared general case single lpsingle configuration believe main reasons effect. first general radar setup discussed paper antennas placed close proximities therefore direct signal transmitted antenna antenna comparable strength desired reflected signal target. such even small portion signal leakage desensitize receiver chain destroy target signal. furthermore signal leakage cause offset degrades performance. isolation antennas especially vital case monitoring human subjects reflected signal heart-beat extremely small easily buried background noise interferences. generally understood isotropic antennas communicating polarization mismatch lp-cp arrangement higher lp-lp arrangement work observing similar effect radar setup. also using effect benefit improve tx/rx isolation reduce unwanted signal leakage accordingly signal leakage system reduced using lp-cp combination using antenna array side since array narrower beamwidth single patch therefore reduces interferences. order better understand coupling effect measured combination sets antennas using anritsu -ghz vector network analyzer measurements performed environment experiments took place. fig. shows measurement setup. antennas placed side-byside apart other. measurement results fig. follow expected trends. plot shows coupling antennas therefore lower value higher isolation isolation identical configurations better antennas instance isolation single array better single array also antenna array used coupling reduced. instance isolation single single array value increases please note measurements measured pair antennas facing free space result s=s. also although using array array provides highest isolation provide best case fig. reason single patch antenna wider beamwidth illuminate larger area target increases backscattered signal level. measurements confirm effect influential. second reason enhanced performance single lp-cp array arrangement transmitted wave hits moving target portion wave-front reflected doppler shift polarization change. change polarization depends distance radar target angle incidence target’s surface area roughness target’s surface circularly-polarized receiver antenna able capture horizontally-polarized vertically-polarized incoming waves. hand horizontal antenna cannot receive incoming signal vertical antenna vice versa. therefore using antenna receiver ensure matter polarization changes portion incoming wave received. also main reasons practice mobile wimax base stations exploit antennas dual-polarized antennas. paper used effect benefit using antenna receiver side. another interesting phenomenon observed measurements proposed single lp-cp array arrangement lower noise floor compared single lp-single arrangement. fig. shows thesystem noise floor cases. seen fig. system noise floor single lp-single case almost higher noise floor array antenna reason lp-cp case receives much lower interference clutter signals. also energy coupling signal leakage case lower lp-lp case. effect
