The first part concerns AI-based tools for assisting with art making. The history of technologies that automated aspects of art is covered, including photography and animation. In each case, we see initial fears and denial of the technology, followed by a blossoming of new creative and professional opportunities for artists. The hype and reality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for art making is discussed, together with predictions about how AI tools will be used. The second part speculates about whether it could ever happen that AI systems could conceive of artwork, and be credited with authorship of an artwork. It is theorized that art is something created by social agents, and so computers cannot be credited with authorship of art in our current understanding. A few ways that this could change are also hypothesized.", "text": "essay discusses whether computers using artiﬁcial intelligence could create art. ﬁrst part concerns ai-based tools assisting making. history technologies automated aspects covered including photography animation. case initial fears denial technology followed blossoming creative professional opportunities artists. hype reality artiﬁcial intelligence tools making discussed together predictions tools used. second part speculates whether could ever happen systems could conceive artwork credited authorship artwork. theorized something created social agents computers cannot credited authorship current understanding. ways could change also hypothesized. artiﬁcial intelligence research made staggering advances recently including many publicly-visible developments search image recognition conversational agents robotics. developments stoked fear artiﬁcial intelligence’s effect many aspects society. context news media hype presents image video creation algorithms automating creation art. perhaps empower everyday users putting artists work... they’re humanity? beyond hype confusion technology inﬂuences pervades serious discussions. professional artists often concerned computers might jobs ∗this essay expresses opinions employer. manuscript submitted journal arts special issue machine artist invitation. please send comments hertzmandgp.toronto.edu. however cannot promise respond feedback. concern i’ve heard decades. practitioners present algorithms themselves potentially artists journalists recently contacted prominent social psychologist inspired recent results neural networks wished conduct experiments assess whether ordinary people might willing artwork made computer why. assumed computers already happily making artwork. hand whenever informally asked friends colleagues question whether computers create answer usually decisive requires human intent inspiration desire express something. thus deﬁnition thing created computer... would anyone worry? concepts inspiration often spoken mystical terms something special primal beyond realm science technology;

even today portrait painting symbol great wealth status. century number inexpensive alternatives developed silhouette tiny black representation individual’s outline typically handcut artisan black paper. daguerreotype offered economical create realistic portrait slow required locking subject’s head place head brace several minutes subject gripped chair tightly ﬂutter ﬁngers. nonetheless numerous daguerreotype studios arose became commonplace technologies improved many portraitists switched technology. painter-photographer named henri secq said knows photography harmed painting considerably killed portraiture especially livelihood artist. photography largely replaced older forms portraiture silhouette seems particularly regret loss. much appreciate mystery beauty looking etchings portraits rather mobile phone camera pictures paint hand. another early daguerreotype produce souvenirs tourists daguerreotypes roman ruins completely replaced etchings lithographs tourists previously purchased. technology improved photography became indispensable source records engineering projects disappearing architectural ruins well photography art? question debated many decades coalescing three main positions. many people believed photography could made mechanical device rather human creativity. many artists dismissive photography threat real art. second view photography could useful real artists reference considered equal drawing painting. finally third group relating photography established forms like etching lithography felt photography could eventually signiﬁcant form painting. photography ultimately profound unexpected effect painting. painters’ mimetic abilities improving centuries. many painters century pre-raphaelites like john everett millais neoclassicists like ingres painted depictions world dazzling realism ever seen before. however cameras became cheaper lighter easier grew widespread among amateurs professionals. realistic photographs became commonplace century. photorealism could reduced mechanical process artist’s role? question drove painters away visual realism toward different forms abstraction. james mcneill whistler’s tonalist movement created atmospheric moody scenes; wrote imitator poor kind creature. paints tree ﬂower surface sees artist king artists would photographer. artist something beyond this. impressionists sought capture perceptions scenes likely inﬂuenced perceptual imperfections photographs. contrast symbolists post-impressionist artists moved away perceptual realism altogether. edvard munch wrote fear photography long cannot used heaven hell. going paint people breathe feel love suffer. vincent gogh describing artistic breakthroughs around wrote brother must boldly exaggerate effects either harmony discord colors produce. thing drawing accurate drawing accurate color perhaps essential thing reﬂection reality mirror could caught color would picture photograph. photography continued inﬂuence modern century;

culminating buffalo show organized alfred stieglitz albright gallery buffalo ﬁrst photography exhibition american museum photography ﬁrmly established free move beyond pretensions pictorialism. story provides several lessons directly relevant artistic tool. ﬁrst photography like seen many non-artistic mechanical process. photography threat argued legitimacy. photography displace technologies fulﬁlled non-artistic functions portraiture’s social function. artists enthusiastically embraced technology began explore potential. technology improved became widespread nearly century artists learned better control express technology real controversy status photography. technology made imagemaking much accessible non-experts hobbyists; today everyone experiment photography. furthermore technology breathed life form provoking toward greater abstraction. wherever controversy artistic tool predict trajectory. eventually tools fully recognized artists’ tools; tools stimulate traditional media well e.g. aesthetic story ﬁlmmaking technology important lessons artists technologists work together pushing further. early photographers were necessity artists technologists experimenting techniques driven inspire art. animation interaction much central form. figure interplay painting early photography. century western painters achieved dazzling levels realism. early cameras took low-quality pictures. daguerreotype took minutes expose. however camera technology steadily improved capturing greater greater realism much faster exposures. challenged painters create works hyper-realistic depiction whistler’s tonalist nocturne. pictorialist photographers attempted establish photography form mimicking styles abstraction painting. works ophelia john everett millais boulevard temple daguerre portrait sarah bernhardt f´elix nadar nocturne blue gold battersea bridge james macneill whistler morning clarence white figure technological developments ﬁlmmaking ﬁrst captured workers leaving lumiere brothers’ factory george m´eli`es’ trip moon ﬁlmed like stage play fantastical special effects citizen kane used numerous experimental camera lens effects tell story. history ﬁlled artist-tinkerers well teams artists technologists. lumi`ere brothers created ﬁrst simple recording workers leaving factory also experimented wide range camera technologies color processing artistic ways them. stage magician george m´eli`es ﬁlmed fantastical stories like trip moon employing wide range clever in-camera tricks techniques create delightfully inventive beguiling ﬁlms. walt disney employed pushed technologies sound color recording drove innovations along multiplane camera. many orson welles’ innovative techniques made possible camera lenses employed cinematographer gregg toland. introduction portable camera audio equipment enabled experiments french wave turn inﬂuenced young american directors like francis ford coppola george lucas. george lucas’ team star wars early developer many visual effects shoestring budget well early innovation digital editing compositing digital computer graphics technology have obviously revolutionized storytelling since then directors like michel gondry james cameron pushing technology unforeseen directions. case technologies rapidly adopted directors create storytelling techniques styles transforming medium over. computer animation artform pioneered pixar animation studios success close collaboration artists engineers began catmull animation enthusiast received computer science thesis invented several core techniques every major computer graphics system uses today. time graduate school quietly goal himself make world’s ﬁrst computer-animated consequently founded lucasﬁlm computer division hired team brilliant engineers invent computer systems used ﬁlm-making. however none group could animate bring character life movement. hence catmull recruited john lasseter animator trained deeply disney tradition. tight collaboration lasseter technical staff able invent technologies discover together computer animation could start become form group spun pixar following years invented numerous technical innovations aimed answering needs pixar’s artists;

news media algorithms often anthropomorphized consciousness humans sometimes described artists fact really know consciousness would mean embody algorithm. today most-successful machine learning algorithms best thought gloriﬁed data-ﬁtting procedures algorithms basically like ﬁtting curve datapoints except sophisticated ways high-dimensional curves millions datapoints. researchers speak training algorithm algorithm learns easy misinterpret thing human learning. words mean quite different things contexts. general training model learn task involves careful human effort formulate problem acquire appropriate data test compared human intelligence algorithms brittle bespoke. example image recognition algorithms undergone breathtaking breakthroughs past decade widely used consumer products. often fail inputs suggest bizarre misunderstandings; existence robustness adversarial examples procedurally-evolved images demonstrates algorithms haven’t really learned anything like human-level understanding. algorithm learned general purpose understanding world. like tourist foreign country repeat combine phrases phrasebook lacks true understanding language culture visiting. systems autonomy except within narrow scope trained typically failsafes must place well indeed fascinating parallels human learning machine learning seem likely humans machines optimization evolutionary principles going high-level analogies actual machine intelligence problem solution even horizon. based history make several speciﬁc claims technology changes art. replacing artists technologies become tools artists invigorating changing culture. claims apply equally current developments previous developments like photography animation. every technology currently employ whether photography software algorithm technologies algorithms basic tools like brushes paint. true ai-based algorithms appearing. always predictable results often surprising delightful could said watercolor ﬂows page. plausible sense current systems reﬂect true artiﬁcial intelligence always human behind artwork. applying standard current research neural networks neural style transfer would seem equally perverse assign authorship outputs software itself. deepdream software authored human; another human selected this view reﬂects think conventional wisdom computer graphics research ﬁeld research background. ﬁeld always close ties certain artistic communities especially computer animation visual effects based experience ﬁeld often resistant attempts automate creative tasks. contrast artiﬁcial intelligence researchers terminology much aspirationally historically using words like intelligence learning expert systems ways simpler human versions things. input image experimented many parameter settings running software obtaining good results. indeed recent exhibition meant promote methods exploration human artists credited individual works. process selection tools inputs adjusting settings even modifying code iterating desirable output produced occurs current computer artworks. cases algorithms presented artists potential artists reasons think claim misunderstands nature procedural art. rather afraid technologies enthusiastic artworks enable artists produce. think external inﬂuences normally think social political inﬂuences ignore effect tools. contrast argue that especially centuries technological developments played pivotal role advancing keeping vital injecting fresh ideas. stories gave photography cinema include many examples this. however effect widespread. important breakthroughs history western invention paint flemish painters eyck century previously painting done primarily tempera lack subtle coloration fresco cumbersome paint. paint existed form centuries before eyck others found techniques compounds gave practical medium fast drying allowed create richer colors sharp edges hard surfaces much wider gamut colors. rich light color associate northern renaissance italian renaissance technology decade since many culturally-important works used technology invented within previous years. example technology used today’s feature ﬁlms exist years goes artworks using smartphones crowdsourcing;

someone worthy empathy ethical consideration. many behaviors interactions social agents gifts conversation social relationships like friendship competition romance. contrast emotionally attached computers possessions feel real empathy needs ethical duty toward them. possessions participate shallow versions interactions. example frequently talk possessions statements like brakes bicycle complaining gave pair gift it’s much happier. love bike. statement indicates emotional attachment true empathy bike’s feelings despite anthropomorphizing language. don’t live social hierarchy possessions compete status impress them. care people because care people; care computers insofar useful generally treat conversational agents user interfaces software like people. help practice skills like dexterity problem solving. creating often pleasurable meditative itself. beneﬁts secondary social beneﬁts reasons evolution produced human activity. similarly also talk sing oneself alone talking singing still fundamentally social activities. seen despite many technological advances current algorithms accepted artists. existing examples objects created authors processes human-driven. give support theory. natural processes. natural processes including landscapes like grand canyon huangshan mountains considered even though extraordinarily beautiful change one’s perspective immensely. beautiful structures made instinctively animals honeycombs coral considered art. indicates simply creating complex beautiful outputs sufﬁcient since creative social communication cases. animals. higher mammals including chimpanzees elephants dolphins trained paint many writers skeptical animal-made art. typically animal’s owner handler steers process letting animal throw paint canvas stopping painting believe done selecting works show; animals seem show interest artwork afterward. animal artwork signiﬁcant cultural impact popularity; seems largely product media stunts. copyright allows humans claim copyright.) interesting aspect discussion whether animals create decide. discussions whether animal-made artifacts based priori rules whether animals artists. instead attempts study evidence animal’s behavior around artwork that infer whether artwork form inner expression artifact animal special appreciation words open idea animals creating social relationships it’s haven’t found creature satisﬁes criteria creating whatever are. quality work produces independent properties computer itself. algorithm outputs continual stream diverse stimulating beautiful and/or skillful outputs without many duds might quite tempted call algorithm artist. better computer-generated becomes hear questions whether computers artists. skill clearly real requirement someone something artist. human make including unskilled amateurs children. conversely computers already programmed create inﬁnite sequences dazzling realistic abstract imagery exhibiting technical proﬁciency beyond typical human’s. suspect that look computer’s output work good enough call computer artist? actually judging quality work instead really looking evidence system intelligent conscious feeling traits associate social agents. matter skillful surprising computer’s output accept artist infer sort social inside. another hypothesis follows modern world role artist supply intent idea work; necessary artist execute work coordinating production. humans clearly true numerous examples section well appropriation works like duchamp’s readymades richard prince’s questionable instagram reproductions; artists also employ helpers crowdworkers scott draves’ electric sheep aaron koblin’s sheep market consequently computer artist simply needs supply intent. easy imagine designing system creates intent even coordinates labor producing work. example could write simple procedural algorithm generate basic intents sample intents recursive neural network trained artists’ statements scraped web. method could randomly select news item photograph historical event randomly sample attitude toward thing. starting intent crowdworkers could used reﬁne idea convert image similar systems like soylent could also automate steps process e.g. using gans generate entirely starting images scratch. crowdworkers could also used rate evaluate outputs system selecting best results discarding rest. final steps process could also automatically hire professional designers e.g. sites like upwork designs. system could continuously generating images time workers could group images common themes intents create separate collections around themes. artist’s statements could generated around themes. system’s preferences could grow adapt time data gathered external data streams change. suppose someone build system calling intent machine exhibits work show gallery. suppose moreover convinced curator gallery owner credit intent machine authorship works it’d created fully disclosed procedure worked. would people credit artist authored works would system-builder real artist here? believe that general consensus would system-builder real artist here really artwork probing nature computer-generated nature commercial artworld. note procedure used deﬁne system fundamentally different procedural computer-generated algorithm even work ended quite good viewers would good doubtful computer’s contribution would judged signiﬁcant beyond humans involved. several authors proposed energy terms criteria creativity often attempts express idea system’s output somehow surpass human programmer and/or training data. example proposes judge creativity system part whether system’s output surprises system’s author. believe weak criterion since many mechanical algorithmic phenomena surprising discoverer author ﬁrst. example basic algorithm produces mandelbrot images speciﬁed single sentence produces dazzling animations inﬁnite complexity. mandelbrot surprising produces beautiful current procedural systems mandelbrot recognizable style awhile lose novelty. believe true systems speciﬁcally designed creativity objectives unlike human artists systems grow evolve time. perhaps artist would need exhibit form growth. example harold cohen ﬁne-art painter began write software generate described evolution views years would said ‘look program own.’ another years would said ‘the fact program central issue here’ denoting belief program’s potential growing autonomy whole business art-making. producing complex images high quality could forever without rewriting single line code. much autonomous get? it’s virtually impossible imagine human similar position. human artist modiﬁed making art. program similarly self-modifying would required merely capable assessing output modiﬁable worldview existing system easy think trivial ways system evolve change time e.g. subtly change color palette training data years. superﬁcial growth easy; meaningful growth hard even deﬁne computer someone could design system produces sequence meaningful people also signiﬁcantly evolves time would truly remarkable. seems hard imagine achieving without enormous technological advances possible without true social form. guidance nature could also looked existing deﬁnitions art. however royal society prescribes valid art. instead phenomenon results interplay cultural institutions general population analyze changes time. philosophers attempted devise concise deﬁnitions include existing types styles art. institutional deﬁnition originated response conceptual states roughly anything style broadly accepted ﬁne-grained approach identify attributes common many different types deﬁnitions attempt data draw line things call understandably deﬁnitions assume artist always human without exploring much whether non-humans create thus don’t provide much guidance discussion. background turn speculating future. seen authorship current algorithmic assigned human author behind algorithms. ever created art? ever recognize piece software author work art? human-level ever develop human-level artiﬁcial intelligence consciousness deﬁnition would able create since would capacity consciousness emotions social relationships. discussed section scenario science ﬁction idea possible would achieved. making meaningful predictions world true impossible little idea speciﬁcally would actually operate. moreover would transform society much make unrecognizable well speculate kind artwork made aliens outer-space ever meet them pressing questions kind music like. social argued creating fundamentally social expression communication follows granted authorship view social agent performing communication sharing art. mean view social agent? view deserving empathy ethical consideration way. however need human-level intelligence; social relationships pets. expect something socially suggest inner consciousness feeling. short true intelligence think happen shallow agents. people sometimes fooled shallow classic example eliza simple text-based psychiatrist program developed based simple pattern-matching repetition user types meant demonstration superﬁciality time unexpectedly many people attributed human-like emotions machine. since then many anecdotes people fooled chatbots online settings including recent plague twitter bots veil lifted clear chatbots don’t exhibit real intelligence. software robots designed relationships owners including talking baby dolls tamagotchi paro therapeutic baby seals. related effect people behave toward computers social agents certain ways even don’t believe intelligent. example dialogue systems like siri alexa female voices default based many ﬁndings male female users respond better female voices come agents integrated daily lives forget carefully-designed software. easily imagine development simulates emotion affection toward user; easy imagine example doll paints pictures owner along many behaviors designed display companionship affection. non-social seems possible non-social algorithms could successfully promoted artists; tentative forays direction e.g. reasons given above skeptical methods accepted true artists without plausible belief underlying social and/or conscious attributes. perhaps curator well-known museum would download otherwise acquire various artifacts software artists list software systems authors. would controversy discussion newspapers journals. perhaps curators galleries would follow suit. perhaps people would enough value computer-generated artworks also convinced human could rightly given credit works. sort process happened things like abstract expressionism chimpanzee art. could happen computer art? suitcase words. term artist could come used multiple meanings words like intelligence learning come mean something different humans algorithms software program that automatically stylizes photos could called artist software applications like calendar mail programs replaced physical-world namesakes. unfortunately word mean different things different contexts causes endless confusion discussed section dangers. continual danger technology human users misunderstand nature call shallow artist risk seriously misleading lying people. believe that convince people artist also falsely attribute emotions feelings ethical weight true would argue calling artists unethical. leads sorts dangers including overselling competence abilities misleading people nature art. seems likely companies scruples this. example hanson robotics promoted social robot truly intelligent being even though clearly nothing chatbot face yann lecun’s words potemkin related concern deprive ai’s designer authorship credit. present credit author piece automatic software output software. usually acknowledges skill effort required engineer iterate software produces good outputs. artistic credit important understanding real sources something made. believe software system current understanding could called artist. social activity. mean warning misleading oneself others nature art. course ambitious reader could take challenge laid serious objections must overcome wish create software artist. don’t think done anytime soon also know proving critics wrong ways science advance. main goals essay highlight degree technology contributes rather antagonistic. lucky alive time artists explore ever-more-powerful tools. every time artist create something wonderful technology little thrill feels like form evolving. danny rosin’s wooden mirror jason salavon’s grossing film time sabiston’s snack drink michel gondry’s like rolling stone kutiman’s thruyou amon tobin’s permutation bogost’s clicker christian marclay’s video installations ´i˜nigo quilez’s procedural renderings wesley allsbrook’s goro fujita’s virtual reality paintings examples artworks affected years. today github twitter extremely fast interplay machine learning researchers artists;
