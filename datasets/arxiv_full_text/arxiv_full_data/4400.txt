{"title": "A Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network for X-ray Low-dose CT Image  Denoising", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML", "I.2.6; I.4.3; J.3"], "abstract": "Image denoising techniques are essential to reducing noise levels and enhancing diagnosis reliability in low-dose computed tomography (CT). Machine learning based denoising methods have shown great potential in removing the complex and spatial-variant noises in CT images. However, some residue artifacts would appear in the denoised image due to complexity of noises. A cascaded training network was proposed in this work, where the trained CNN was applied on the training dataset to initiate new trainings and remove artifacts induced by denoising. A cascades of convolutional neural networks (CNN) were built iteratively to achieve better performance with simple CNN structures. Experiments were carried out on 2016 Low-dose CT Grand Challenge datasets to evaluate the method's performance.", "text": "denoising methods able handle complicated noises. jain seung demonstrated
