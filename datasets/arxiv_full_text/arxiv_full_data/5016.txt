{"title": "FSL-BM: Fuzzy Supervised Learning with Binary Meta-Feature for  Classification", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel real-time Fuzzy Supervised Learning with Binary Meta-Feature (FSL-BM) for big data classification task. The study of real-time algorithms addresses several major concerns, which are namely: accuracy, memory consumption, and ability to stretch assumptions and time complexity. Attaining a fast computational model providing fuzzy logic and supervised learning is one of the main challenges in the machine learning. In this research paper, we present FSL-BM algorithm as an efficient solution of supervised learning with fuzzy logic processing using binary meta-feature representation using Hamming Distance and Hash function to relax assumptions. While many studies focused on reducing time complexity and increasing accuracy during the last decade, the novel contribution of this proposed solution comes through integration of Hamming Distance, Hash function, binary meta-features, binary classification to provide real time supervised method. Hash Tables (HT) component gives a fast access to existing indices; and therefore, the generation of new indices in a constant time complexity, which supersedes existing fuzzy supervised algorithms with better or comparable results. To summarize, the main contribution of this technique for real-time Fuzzy Supervised Learning is to represent hypothesis through binary input as meta-feature space and creating the Fuzzy Supervised Hash table to train and validate model.", "text": "abstract—this paper introduces novel real-time fuzzy supervised learning binary meta-feature data classiﬁcation task. study real-time algorithms addresses several major concerns namely accuracy memory consumption ability stretch assumptions time complexity. attaining fast computational model providing fuzzy logic supervised learning main challenges machine learning. research paper present fslbm algorithm efﬁcient solution supervised learning fuzzy logic processing using binary meta-feature representation using hamming distance hash function relax assumptions. many studies focused reducing time complexity increasing accuracy last decade novel contribution proposed solution comes integration hamming distance hash function binary meta-features binary classiﬁcation provide real time supervised method. hash tables component gives fast access existing indices;
