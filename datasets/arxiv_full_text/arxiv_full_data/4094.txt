{"title": "Fuzzy human motion analysis: A review", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Human Motion Analysis (HMA) is currently one of the most popularly active research domains as such significant research interests are motivated by a number of real world applications such as video surveillance, sports analysis, healthcare monitoring and so on. However, most of these real world applications face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA.", "text": "human motion analysis currently

problem identifying different human activities e.g. running. rules designed infer running activity using simple following rule rule however real world scenarios various factors affect speed person height body size etc. therefore order make system closer natural solution rules needed modiﬁed accordingly. intuitively observe styles running tall person shorter person difference step size feet taller person tends faster speed larger step size compared shorter person running moderate speed. however performing running activity different rules. situation modeled modifying rule follows conventional rules built help human expert knowledge. example case experts doctor police forensic expert researcher etc. information provide considered reliable build based real life experiences historical analysis. however human intervention intelligent system becoming threat heuristic subjectivity human decisions. therefore automated learning systems emerged widely employed research society
