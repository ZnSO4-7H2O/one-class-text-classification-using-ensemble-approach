{"title": "Loopy Belief Propagation for Approximate Inference: An Empirical Study", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Recently, researchers have demonstrated that loopy belief propagation - the use of Pearls polytree algorithm IN a Bayesian network WITH loops OF error- correcting codes.The most dramatic instance OF this IS the near Shannon - limit performance OF Turbo Codes codes whose decoding algorithm IS equivalent TO loopy belief propagation IN a chain - structured Bayesian network. IN this paper we ask : IS there something special about the error - correcting code context, OR does loopy propagation WORK AS an approximate inference schemeIN a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation TO the exact ones IN four Bayesian network architectures, including two real - world networks : ALARM AND QMR.We find that the loopy beliefs often converge AND WHEN they do, they give a good approximation TO the correct marginals.However,ON the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated AND had no obvious relationship TO the correct posteriors. We present SOME initial investigations INTO the cause OF these oscillations, AND show that SOME simple methods OF preventing them lead TO the wrong results.", "text": "recently \"loopy belief pearl's network loops context dramatic near shannon-limit codes\" codes whose equivalent chain-structured paper something cial error-correcting loopy propagation proximate eral setting? marginals puted using loopy propagation exact ones four bayesian network including qmr. find loopy beliefs converge good approximation however liefs oscillated ship correct initial oscillations methods preventing wrong results. loops present connected longer singly tion schemes invariably ignore existence permit nodes continue network singly definitely converge oscillations probabilistic messages time goes however librium represent nodes loopy propagation. sophisticated markov blanket paper evaluate loopy propagation rather exhaustively compare native algorithms. likelihood network used synthetic toyqmr real world networks qmr. synthetic perform tion tree algorithm. scheme. curacy approximation sizes. many loops different qmr-dt bipartite shown figure size much larger. proximately served noisy-or ponential lowing focused number positive exact inference algorithm figure network works arise medical eases layer observed bottom layer. randomized experiment parameters node bottom layer randomly nodes layer. chosen using simple procedure link either found loopy belief verged case average ations tion plot junction tree) convergence). equation shows correlation weighting sampler loopy propagation. would priors case? answer question periments prior probability calculated posteriors domly selected uniformly previous nodes sampling findings would trivial. rather finding independently positive small priors find oscillatory network qmr-dt network used fixed structure four cases posteriors culated four cases rather loopy marginal oscillated values nearly nodes. figure shows three marginals. seems converge figure seems correct ways inside however interval indeed small priors tion would expect real network converge range check this reran loopy propaga­ tion full network cases changed range parameters remained found real network. convergence good correlation quickscore. reparameterized test hypothesis network prior probability state root nodes utilized noisy-or inhibition inhibited eterization layer bottom. thus true marginal leaf skewed distribu­ tion found loopy propagation converged converged marginals. thus tion besides cillations", "year": 2013}
