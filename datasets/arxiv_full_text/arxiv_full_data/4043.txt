{"title": "On Considering Uncertainty and Alternatives in Low-Level Vision", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "In this paper we address the uncertainty issues involved in the low-level vision task of image segmentation. Researchers in computer vision have worked extensively on this problem, in which the goal is to partition (or segment) an image into regions that are homogeneous or uniform in some sense. This segmentation is often utilized by some higher level process, such as an object recognition system. We show that by considering uncertainty in a Bayesian formalism, we can use statistical image models to build an approximate representation of a probability distribution over a space of alternative segmentations. We give detailed descriptions of the various levels of uncertainty associated with this problem, discuss the interaction of prior and posterior distributions, and provide the operations for constructing this representation.", "text": "paper address sues involved image segmentation. puter vision problem segment) mogeneous segmentation level process system. tainty statistical imate representation bution space alternative tions. give detailed various levels problem posterior operations tion. taken traditional statistical fields probabilistic stead statistical bayesian posterior image partitions. requires tive segments effectiveness properties probability concepts precise consider intuitively homogeneous formalized predicate). uniformity elements element assumed given homogeneity prediÂ­ cate applies predicate mogeneous image segmentation vision problem typically homogeneous often purpose though considerable approaches ficult general pointed segmentation \"correct\" depends result. underconstrain certainty problem assume segmentation solved example cients model used silverman cooper parameter maximal rameter information ated parameter values determine ideal segmentation trivially bayesian combine evidence bayesian approach evidence tiple model approach model prior distribution sibly higher-level) tion reflects directly applied tributions also region space alternatives strained using low-level proach introduce higher-level occur single parently best segmentation cess. single decisions formation segmentation alternative begin applied constrain unique solution. typical application particular regarding tion segments measure information natural measure information function distribution probability measure uncertainty indicate information shown figure associated organized section mentations; here. region resentation and/or coordinates information. array way. given point bors adjacent. could also consider agonally element uniquely regions particular specifically every segment r;). exclusion included resentations region note using notation point region-merging given problem regions region. initial struct segmentations standard approach justification achieved considering another tations. points required effectively resents starting instance image blocks image grid square regions merged yield clusters implication image partitions segment {rrr} regions sense defined above. given representation construction define notions cover refinement scribe imations high probability large subsets values. however ment represented either define -cover pairwise-disjoint denote singleton exact representation explicitly given. hence case entire fully determined obtained b;). thus t-covers poorest however probabilities cannot directly -covers expression region ensure connected sented t-cover region termed t-refinement termed refined -cover respect difference events thus t-refinement event subsets include maining elements singleton segment. refer events since events first introduced interested similar partition application t-refinements considered select event. corresponding segment; hence different ments. selection used form considers ings 'rt;. at-cover partition holding approximation event segmentations initial region continues vidual strategy assumed inductively probabilities mined. first refinement reflecting iteration probability priors termine probability assignments hence probabilities assumed probability never altered refinement operation. general could cause could case evidence increase paper specific describe portant note could considered considered. taxonomic method propagating events ties throughout work construction hierarchy ment mapping change much difficult note since known inductively need determilie right side alternative expressions refinement third final type uniformity membership assumption bilities associated corresponds ability including prior probability ment. membership formity number regions experiments readily observed segmentation fact segments prior probability) plane direction pla.ne background. pyramid coordinates pyramid makes problem suggest. figure shows algorithm. judge effectiveness cuted ma.ny experiments data. synthetic ments performed noise parameters sulting level increases priors. results developed cope difficulties", "year": 2013}
