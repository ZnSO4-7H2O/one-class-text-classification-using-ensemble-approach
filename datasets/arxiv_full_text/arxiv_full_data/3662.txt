{"title": "Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Lexicon Method, Machine Learning Method and  Their Combination", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "stat.ME", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "This paper covers the two approaches for sentiment analysis: i) lexicon based method; ii) machine learning method. We describe several techniques to implement these approaches and discuss how they can be adopted for sentiment classification of Twitter messages. We present a comparative study of different lexicon combinations and show that enhancing sentiment lexicons with emoticons, abbreviations and social-media slang expressions increases the accuracy of lexicon-based classification for Twitter. We discuss the importance of feature generation and feature selection processes for machine learning sentiment classification. To quantify the performance of the main sentiment analysis methods over Twitter we run these algorithms on a benchmark Twitter dataset from the SemEval-2013 competition, task 2-B. The results show that machine learning method based on SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers outperforms the lexicon method. We present a new ensemble method that uses a lexicon based sentiment score as input feature for the machine learning approach. The combined method proved to produce more precise classifications. We also show that employing a cost-sensitive classifier for highly unbalanced datasets yields an improvement of sentiment classification performance up to 7%.", "text": "abstract. paper covers

ensemble methods empirically proved ensemble models produce better results base learners fersini proposed bayesian model averaging ensemble method outperformed traditional classiﬁcation ensemble methods carvalho employed genetic algorithms subsets applying sentiment extraction methods common practice perform data pre-processing. data pre-processing allows produce higher quality text classiﬁcation reduce computational complexity. typical pre-processing procedure includes following steps part-of-speech tagging process part-of-speech tagging allows automatically word text terms part speech belongs noun pronoun adverb adjective verb interjection intensiﬁer etc. goal extract patterns text based analysis frequency distributions part-of-speech. importance part-of-speech tagging correct sentiment analysis demonstrated statistical properties texts adherence zipfs also used paroubek analysed distribution tagging speciﬁcally twitter messages identiﬁed multiple patterns instance found subjective texts often contain pronouns rather common proper nouns; subjective messages often past simple tense contain many verbs base form many modal verbs. common opinion whether tagging improves results sentiment classiﬁcation. barbosa feng reported positive results using tagging reported decrease performance. stemming lemmatisation. stemming procedure replacing words stems roots. dimensionality reduced root-related words read reader reading mapped word read. however careful applying stemming since might increase bias. example biased effect stemming appears merging distinct words experiment experience word exper words ought merged together remain distinct stemming. examples over-stemming under-stemming errors respectively. overstemming lowers precision under-stemming lowers recall. overall impact stemming depends dataset stemming algorithm. popular stemming algorithm porter stemmer stop-words removal. stop words words carry connecting function sentence
