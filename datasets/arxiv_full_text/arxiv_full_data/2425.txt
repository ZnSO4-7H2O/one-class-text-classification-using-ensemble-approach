{"title": "Approximate Inference and Constrained Optimization", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Loopy and generalized belief propagation are popular algorithms for approximate inference in Markov random fields and Bayesian networks. Fixed points of these algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energy. However, belief propagation does not always converge, which explains the need for approaches that explicitly minimize the Kikuchi/Bethe free energy, such as CCCP and UPS. Here we describe a class of algorithms that solves this typically nonconvex constrained minimization of the Kikuchi free energy through a sequence of convex constrained minimizations of upper bounds on the Kikuchi free energy. Intuitively one would expect tighter bounds to lead to faster algorithms, which is indeed convincingly demonstrated in our simulations. Several ideas are applied to obtain tight convex bounds that yield dramatic speed-ups over CCCP.", "text": "kikuchi free energy however generalized belief fixed point guaranteed rithms therefore plicitly energy however agation motivates approaches plicitly cccp describe typ­ algorithms non-convex ically min­ imization problem quence convex constrained mini­ mizations kikuchi would expect faster deed convincingly simulations. ideas several plied obtain tight convex bounds yield dramatic speed-ups cccp. section kikuchi usually problem. tion problems section kikuchi section verging inner loop corresponds mization energy outer-loop lation tighter come several bounds. simulations trate tions discussed parameters bius overcounting written able subsets\" distinguish outer clusters subsets typically outer clusters. constraint fur­ properly fol­ thermore lows -log varia­ tional ergy roughly classes ation\" methods. cluster method represent distribution tributions variables. subsets specify tion potentials. larger curate computational size clusters). redefine clusters overcounting subsets positive tions). lections \"regions\" tially defined operator mceliece sualized gram kikuchi bethe approximation overlapping reasoning energy entropy cave contribution corresponding overcounting tive negative relevant counting free energy non-convex perhaps eliminate cluster free energy functional following tharam \"convex constraints possibly function con­ one. idea formulated theorem kikuchi free ergy convex constraint compensate fconv used convexity tablish min­ imization much sim­ pler constrained minimization non­ convex functional. idea placing complex func­ tional eas­ handle upper bounds popular algorithms gorithm scaling/iterative pfeucil negative matrix intuitively faster bounds fconvl reference bound tighter bounding tropy contributions convex constraint again previous section convex entropy contributions terms bounded anyway. implemented section concave bounded using section rather bound implicit dotted). minimization gorithm report kullback-leibler imate exact single-node row). expect tightest terms outer-loop inner-loop gence inner loop. therefore number inner-loop meet convergence make comparable erations required reach level accuracy. numbers give indi­ inner-loop cation lower kikuchi lem. here well studies proach solve non-convex prob­ tion convex bounds kikuchi ergy. presumption yield faster algorithms several simulation presumption significant. suggested belief propagation makes sense explicitly minimize kikuchi/bethe free energy. others reported single-loop approach verge examples definite alized/loopy belief verge minimum potentials (tatikonda", "year": 2012}
