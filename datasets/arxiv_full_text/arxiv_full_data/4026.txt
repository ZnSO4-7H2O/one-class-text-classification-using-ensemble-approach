{"title": "Model-based Influence Diagrams for Machine Vision", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "We show an approach to automated control of machine vision systems based on incremental creation and evaluation of a particular family of influence diagrams that represent hypotheses of imagery interpretation and possible subsequent processing decisions. In our approach, model-based machine vision techniques are integrated with hierarchical Bayesian inference to provide a framework for representing and matching instances of objects and relationships in imagery and for accruing probabilities to rank order conflicting scene interpretations. We extend a result of Tatman and Shachter to show that the sequence of processing decisions derived from evaluating the diagrams at each stage is the same as the sequence that would have been derived by evaluating the final influence diagram that contains all random variables created during the run of the vision system.", "text": "trol machine vision cremental ticular resent hypotheses possible approach sion techniques bayesian inference representing matching jects relationships cruing probabilities scene interpretations. tatman shachter relations quence processing decisions derived evaluating sequence derived gram contains ated vision observed memory object models. demonstrated efficient ation selecting subclasses structured dexing using coarse scriptions. ettinger strated available hierarchical model-based matching. hierarchical representation sub-parts. tional fine objects gether work orthogonal tion material proach image processing tions used gather denying porting thus relations visual interpretation sub-parts ometric plumbing procedures model represent nodes index executable image evidence gathering model structuring achieve multiple parent search produce representation connected sets pixels likely object boundaries. search pairs edges roughly parallel distance apart candidates sides projected image object modeled. search \"'aggregates\" boundaries cance object recognition. machine vision system image processing aggregation opera­ tors obtain evidence used find local areas image objects present. initial figure-from-ground reasoning viewed bottom-up model matehing models coarsest level ofthe is-a hierarchy i.e. objectfnot­ object\" level. initialized image basic hypotheses \"surface/not-surface\" matching surface models. fundam ental data reduction. show concept aggregation bottom reasoning basis generat­ hypotheses object existence type. aggregation applies constraints geometry image forma­ derstanding tion. aggregation operaiors also corr� spond transformations levels object recognition grouped together level relation­ ships correspond single node next higher level. therefore grouping opera­ tors dictate \"out-degree\" hierarchy tion associated model node corre­ sponds instantiated hypothesis following effects refining searching explain aggregation. show method actions. representing effects actions influence diagram forma.lism. idence aggregate object components evidence nodes. thus inference proceeds choosing actions model space create hypotheses tween them. follows possible inference implicitly evidence direct support search­ sub-parts hierarchy hypothesis peting hypotheses erarchy refined interpretations hypothesized pothesized screwdriver might look grooves hypothesized screwdriver control. control chooses actions locates available turns results inference space ence uses existing hypothesis current results actions generates propagates actions examination selectable approach impossible reason circularly chains inference dence manner consistent base. part-of hierarchy instantiate include current hypothesis part sub-relationship. screwdriver blade aggregate sub-parts hypoth­ esize existence whole screwdriver. namically runtime hypothesis guided priori models objects idence components ships. system control alternates amination instantiated hypotheses models choosing actions take grow instantiated pothesis space seeing structure tions also stored model space either explicitly build model-base allows three kinds nodes;
