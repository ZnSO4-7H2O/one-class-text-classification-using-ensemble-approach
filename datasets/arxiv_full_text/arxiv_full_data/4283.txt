{"title": "Dynamic Mortality Risk Predictions in Pediatric Critical Care Using  Recurrent Neural Networks", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.NE", "math.DS", "q-bio.QM"], "abstract": "Viewing the trajectory of a patient as a dynamical system, a recurrent neural network was developed to learn the course of patient encounters in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a major tertiary care center. Data extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of about 12000 patients who were admitted to the PICU over a period of more than 10 years were leveraged. The RNN model ingests a sequence of measurements which include physiologic observations, laboratory results, administered drugs and interventions, and generates temporally dynamic predictions for in-ICU mortality at user-specified times. The RNN's ICU mortality predictions offer significant improvements over those from two clinically-used scores and static machine learning algorithms.", "text": "viewing trajectory patient dynamical system recurrent neural network developed learn course patient encounters pediatric intensive care unit major tertiary care center. data extracted electronic medical records patients admitted picu period years leveraged. model ingests sequence measurements include physiologic observations laboratory results administered drugs interventions generates temporally dynamic predictions in-icu mortality user-speciﬁed times. rnn’s mortality predictions oﬀer signiﬁcant improvements clinically-used scores static machine learning algorithms. numerous severity illness mortality scoring systems developed past three decades strand flaatten earliest commonly used scores acute physiology chronic health evaluation simpliﬁed acute physiology score rely routine physiologic measurements deviations measurements expert-deﬁned normal values. pediatric critical care pediatric risk mortality score pediatric index mortality developed. leverage physiologic data incorporating calculations additional information pre-icu procedures in-icu ventilation data ﬁrst hour. larger databases reﬁnements systems;
