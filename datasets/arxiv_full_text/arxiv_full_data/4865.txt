{"title": "A New Hierarchical Redundancy Eliminated Tree Augmented Naive Bayes  Classifier for Coping with Gene Ontology-based Features", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "H.2.8; I.5.1; I.5.2"], "abstract": "The Tree Augmented Naive Bayes classifier is a type of probabilistic graphical model that can represent some feature dependencies. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Redundancy Eliminated Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (HRE-TAN) algorithm, which considers removing the hierarchical redundancy during the classifier learning process, when coping with data containing hierarchically structured features. The experiments showed that HRE-TAN obtains significantly better predictive performance than the conventional Tree Augmented Naive Bayes classifier, and enhanced the robustness against imbalanced class distributions, in aging-related gene datasets with Gene Ontology terms used as features.", "text": "wan†‡ alex freitas‡ department computer science university college london london united
