Gait, as a biometric for recognizing human identities, can be non-intrusively captured signals using wearable or portable smart devices. In this study gait patterns is collected using a wireless platform of two sensors located at chest and right ankle of the subjects. Then the raw data has undergone some preprocessing methods and segmented into 5 seconds windows. Some time and frequency domain features is extracted and the performance evaluated by 5 different classifiers. Decision Tree (with all features) and K-Nearest Neighbors (with 10 selected features) classifiers reached 99.4% and 100% respectively.", "text": "motion ability important human properties including gait basis human transitional movement. gait biometric recognizing human identities non-intrusively captured signals using wearable portable smart devices. study gait patterns collected using wireless platform sensors located chest right ankle subjects. data undergone preprocessing methods segmented seconds windows. time frequency domain features extracted performance evaluated different classifiers. decision tree k-nearest neighbors classifiers reached respectively. different biometric approaches identity recognition prominent ones image processing human face development microelectromechanical systems recent years influenced many research areas. important group systems inertial sensors consists accelerometer gyroscope. area absorbed many attentions recently gait analysis. motion ability including gait important traits human since considerable influence quality life. gait analysis approaches applicable security healthcare areas. hand fast development ubiquitous devices inertial sensors integrated applications motion analysis methods extended activity recognition sports wearable sensor platform data collection phase study conducted university michigan wssp collect data gait pattern recognition. total subjects participated data collection procedure. inertial measurement units attached subject. since different research combined together sensors used too. shimmer wireless sensor platform used gait recognition purpose. shimmer small robust wearable wireless sensor cpu. contains inertial sensing accelerometer gyroscope selectable range. data recorded synchronously sensors located right side right ankle center chest subject. sampling rate approximately exclusive java application developed wssp used collect synchronized data sensors annotate desired label. subject asked walk naturally specific point outside building. therefor path approximately equal subject. subjects pass doors walking take left turning. important consideration experiment type floor since plays significant role human gait patterns floor selected path different inside outside building. another consideration subject’s outfit. different session data collection conducted least week interval subjects asked wear different outfits especially shoes. reason consider effect outfit subject’s mood gait patterns. nature data output sensor nodes impossible classify subjects. shows -dimensional accelerometer data ankle node. therefore several features extracted signals used input classifiers. features chosen based application experiment platform complexity data reduced meaningful information extracted data. data analysis recipe includes pre-processing synchronization calibration segmentation feature extraction classification. overview data analysis procedure shown figure steps described section results provided next section. matlab software used data analysis purposes. first output signal related experiment segmented. null values data matrix caused different sampling rate sensors find replaced using linear interpolation. signal calibrated. purpose calibration convert instrument readings units interest eliminate reduce bias instrument's readings. sampling rate accelerometer data exactly slightly change data collection hardware wireless limitation. cause non-uniformly sampled data impact results. therefore resampling algorithm implemented uniformly sampled data results better feature identification improves classification performance extracting features signals chunked using sliding window. window size seconds chosen without overlap. length enough extract stable consistent features feed classifiers. feature extraction algorithm applied window generate feature vector samples labeled specific subjects. total features extracted window signal. features listed follows statistical features standard deviation;
