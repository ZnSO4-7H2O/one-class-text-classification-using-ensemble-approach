{"title": "Bayesian Reinforcement Learning: A Survey", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Bayesian methods for machine learning have been widely investigated, yielding principled methods for incorporating prior information into inference algorithms. In this survey, we provide an in-depth review of the role of Bayesian methods for the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The major incentives for incorporating Bayesian reasoning in RL are: 1) it provides an elegant approach to action-selection (exploration/exploitation) as a function of the uncertainty in learning; and 2) it provides a machinery to incorporate prior knowledge into the algorithms. We first discuss models and methods for Bayesian inference in the simple single-step Bandit model. We then review the extensive recent literature on Bayesian methods for model-based RL, where prior information can be expressed on the parameters of the Markov model. We also present Bayesian methods for model-free RL, where priors are expressed over the value function or policy class. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on Bayesian RL algorithms and their theoretical and empirical properties.", "text": "models representations exploration/exploitation dilemma oï¬„ine value approximation online near-myopic value approximation online tree search approximation methods exploration bonus achieve guarantees extensions unknown rewards pac-bayes model selection bayesian inverse reinforcement learning bayesian multi-agent reinforcement learning bayesian multi-task reinforcement learning", "year": 2016}
