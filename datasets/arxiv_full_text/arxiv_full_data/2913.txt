{"title": "Feature base fusion for splicing forgery detection based on neuro fuzzy", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Most of researches on image forensics have been mainly focused on detection of artifacts introduced by a single processing tool. They lead in the development of many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular footprints under specific settings. Naturally, the performance of such algorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy, inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical scenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by image-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection requires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering scenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System has been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership functions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are time-consuming processes. This can be accounted as main disadvantage of fuzzy inference systems. In this paper, a Neuro-Fuzzy inference system for fusion of forgery detection tools is developed. The neural network characteristic of these systems provides appropriate tool for automatically adjusting the membership functions. Moreover, initial fuzzy inference system is generated based on fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed framework is implemented and validated on a benchmark image splicing data set in which three forgery detection tools are fused based on adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system. The outcome of the proposed method reveals that applying Neuro Fuzzy inference systems could be a better approach for fusion of forgery detection tools.", "text": "abstract researches image forensics mainly focused detection artifacts introduced single processing tool. lead development many specialized algorithms looking particular footprints speciﬁc settings. naturally performance algorithms perfect accordingly provided output might noisy inaccurate partially correct. furthermore forged image practical scenarios often result utilizing several tools available image-processing software systems. therefore reliable tamper detection requires developing poweful tools deal various tempering scenarios. fusion forgery detection tools based fuzzy inference system used addressing problem. adjusting membership functions deﬁning proper fuzzy rules attaining better results time-consuming processes. accounted main disadvantage fuzzy inference systems. paper neuro-fuzzy inference system fusion forgery detection tools developed. neural network characteristic systems provides appropriate tool automatically adjusting membership functions. moreover initial fuzzy inference system generated based fuzzy clustering techniques. proposed framework implemented validated benchmark image splicing data three forgery detection tools fused based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. outcome proposed method reveals applying neuro fuzzy inference systems could better approach fusion forgery detection tools. nowadays exploitation digital images photos taken various smart recording devices getting prevalent along extensive social media like facebook twitter instagram. individuals tend spend considerable amount time surﬁng internet share almost moments lives well events districts festivals concerts dreadful incidents e.g. terrorist attacks armed robberies anti-human rights behaviors. recently many devices exist producing digital images almost communication device access internet equipped digital camera produces high-resolution pictures. snapshots professionally taken images advantage since accounted inevitable part accompanying contexts media help elucidate diﬀerent aspects events time could source troublemaking consequences local global scales. images might mean deliberately cynical distortion reality aimed convey special messages without corroborating documents. manipulated image taken protest intended exaggerate crowd thronged supporting idea might ignored authorities. distorted shots claimed taken private moments celebrities might used extortion imposing favor third parties anomaly background. innate potential quality pictures general digital image particular would make susceptible forgery digital image editing post processing. mentioned issues assert necessity providing reliable tools authenticate originality images attracted many researchers work detecting possible traces forgery. forgery detection methods categorized general branches active passive methods former based idea inserting information inside images authentication proving integrity. information usually inserted either time taking photos post-processing operations. approach needs special kind hardware information could easily altered latter exploits image data detect possible clues forgery. since devices market equipped complicated fancy tools accomplish ﬁrst method consequently taken photos free embedded information passive methods practical diﬀerent kinds passive methods detecting possible forgeries none claims percent accuracy since forgers sometimes professionally manipulate images detection forgery becomes hard even impossible kirchner bohme image splicing copy-paste attack image retouching three examples passive methods. researches focus type methods usually don’t common features photos process hsiao research focus image splicing methods. methods applicable forged image produced integration image. splicing detection challenging problem almost ultimate guaranteeing solution overcome uncertainty neuro-fuzzy inference system fusion features extracted three diﬀerent splicing forgery detection methods;
