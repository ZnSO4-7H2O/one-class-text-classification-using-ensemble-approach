In the area of dialogue systems, the trend is less obvious, and most practical systems are still built through significant engineering and expert knowledge. Nevertheless, several recent results suggest that data-driven approaches are feasible and quite promising. To facilitate research in this area, we have carried out a wide survey of publicly available datasets suitable for data-driven learning of dialogue systems. We discuss important characteristics of these datasets, how they can be used to learn diverse dialogue strategies, and their other potential uses. We also examine methods for transfer learning between datasets and the use of external knowledge. Finally, we discuss appropriate choice of evaluation metrics for the learning objective.", "text": "past decade several areas speech language understanding witnessed substantial breakthroughs

goal-driven dialogue systems technical support services non-goal-driven dialogue systems language learning tools computer game characters. although types systems fact objectives typically goal-driven dialogue systems well-deﬁned measure performance explicitly related task completion. non-goal-driven dialogue systems. research non-goal-driven dialogue systems goes back mid-s. began perhaps weizenbaum’s famous program eliza system based simple text parsing rules managed convincingly mimic rogerian psychotherapist persistently rephrasing statements asking questions line research continued colby used simple text parsing rules construct dialogue system parry managed mimic pathological behaviour paranoid patient extent clinicians could distinguish real patients. however neither systems used data-driven learning approaches. later work megahal system hutchens alder started apply data-driven methods hutchens alder proposed modelling dialogue stochastic sequence discrete symbols using order markov chains. given user utterance system generated response following two-step procedure ﬁrst sequence topic keywords used create seed reply extracted user’s utterance; second starting seed reply separate markov chains generated words preceding proceeding seed keywords. procedure produced many candidate responses highest entropy response returned user. assumption coverage different topics general ﬂuency primary importance order markov chains trained mixture data sources ranging real ﬁctive dialogues arbitrary texts. unfortunately recently data-driven dialogue systems applied widely real-world applications part reason might non-goal-driven nature made hard commercialize. another barrier commercialization might lack theoretical empirical understanding systems. nevertheless similar spirit past years neural network architectures trained large-scale corpora investigated. models demonstrated promising results several non-goal-driven dialogue tasks however require sufﬁciently large corpora hundreds millions even billions words order achieve results. goal-driven dialogue systems. initial work goal-driven dialogue systems primarily based deterministic hand-crafted rules coupled learned speech recognition models example sundial project capable providing timetable information trains airplanes well taking airplane reservations later machine learning techniques used classify intention user well bridge text speech research area started take researchers began formulate dialogue sequential decision making problem based markov decision processes unlike non-goal-driven systems industry played major role enabled researchers access relatively large dialogue corpora certain tasks recordings technical support call centres. although research past decade continued push ﬁeld towards data-driven approaches commercial systems highly domain-speciﬁc heavily based hand-crafted rules features particular many tasks datasets available constrained narrow domains. modern dialogue systems consist several components illustrated figure several dialogue system components learned so-called discriminative models predict labels annotations relevant parts dialogue system. discriminative models fall machine learning paradigm supervised learning. labels interest discrete models called classiﬁcation models common case. labels interest continuous models called regression models. popular approach tackling discriminative task learn probabilistic model labels conditioned available information label interest available information another popular approach maximum margin classiﬁers support vector machines natural language interpreter. example discriminative model user intent classiﬁcation model acts natural language interpreter. model trained predict intent user conditioned utterances user. case intent called label conditioned utterances called conditioning variables training model requires examples pairs user utterances intentions. obtain example pairs would ﬁrst record written dialogues humans carrying task humans annotate utterance intention label. depending complexity domain require training human annotators reach certain level agreement annotators. dialogue state tracker. dialogue state tracker might similarly implemented classiﬁcation model given point dialogue model take input user utterances user intention labels estimated natural language interpreter model output distribution possible dialogue states. common represent dialogue states slot-value pairs. example dialogue system providing timetable information trains might three different slots departure city arrival city departure time. slot take several discrete values task dialogue state tracker output distribution every possible combination slot-value pairs. distribution alternatively dialogue states highest probability used parts dialogue system. dialogue state tracker model trained examples dialogue utterances dialogue states labelled humans. dialogue response selection. given dialogue state distribution provided dialogue state tracker dialogue response selection component must select correct system response component also implemented classiﬁcation model maps dialogue states probability discrete responses. example dialogue system providing timetable information trains responses might include providing information clariﬁcation questions model trained example pairs dialogue states responses. natural language generator. given dialogue system response natural language generator must output natural language utterance system. often implemented commercial goal-driven dialogue systems using hand-crafted rules. another option learn discriminative model select natural language response. case output space deﬁned so-called surface form sentences given system response classiﬁcation model must choose appropriate surface form. afterwards chosen surface form placeholder values substituted appropriately classiﬁcation models model trained example pairs system responses surface forms. discriminative models allowed goal-driven dialogue systems make signiﬁcant progress proper annotations discriminative models evaluated automatically accurately. furthermore trained given dataset models plugged fully-deployed dialogue system dialogue systems conform architecture shown figure particular so-called end-to-end dialogue system architectures based neural networks shown promising results several dialogue tasks purest form models take input dialogue text form output response call systems end-to-end dialogue systems possess important properties. first contain require learning sub-components consequently need collect intermediate labels second model parameters optimized w.r.t. single objective function. often objective function chosen maximum log-likelihood ﬁxed corpus dialogues. although original formulation models depended dialogue context extended also depend outputs components external knowledge end-to-end dialogue systems divided categories select deterministically ﬁxed possible responses attempt generate responses keeping posterior distribution possible utterances. systems ﬁrst category dialogue history tracker outputs external knowledge dialogue system response action time parameters deﬁnes information retrieval ranking-based systems systems search database dialogues pick responses similar context model proposed banchs belong category. case mapping function projects dialogue history euclidean space response found projecting potential responses euclidean space response closest desirable response region selected. neural network proposed lowe also belongs category. case dialogue history projected euclidean space using recurrent neural network encoding dialogue word-by-word. similarly candidate responses mapped euclidean space using another recurrent neural network encoding response word-by-word. finally relevance score computed dialogue context candidate response response highest score returned. hybrid combined models model built phrase-based statistical machine translation system recurrent neural network proposed sordoni also belong category. case response generated deterministically creating ﬁxed number answers using machine translation system picking response according score given neural network. although sub-components based probabilistic models ﬁnal model construct probability distribution possible responses. systems based generative recurrent neural networks belong category breaking product probabilities words responses generated sampling word-by-word probability distribution. unlike deterministic response models systems also able generate entirely novel responses highly probable responses i.e. response highest probability further generated using method known beam-search systems project word euclidean space also project dialogue history external knowledge euclidean space similarly system proposed ritter belongs category. model uses statistical machine translation model dialogue history response. trained solely text generative models viewed unsupervised learning models reproduce data distributions. words models learn assign probability every possible conversation since generate responses word word must learn simulate behaviour agents training corpus. early reinforcement learning dialogue systems stochastic policies also belong category example this). contrast neural network statistical machine translation systems reinforcement learning systems typically small sets possible hand-crafted system states action space also limited small pre-deﬁned responses. makes possible apply established reinforcement learning algorithms train either online ofﬂine however also severely limits application area. singh remark view design appropriate state space application-dependent task skilled system designer. section provides high-level discussion different types dialogue interactions salient aspects. categorization dialogues useful understanding utility various datasets particular applications well grouping datasets together demonstrate available corpora given area. important distinction dialogue corpora whether participants interact written language spoken language multi-modal setting written spoken language differ substantially w.r.t. linguistic properties. .spoken language tends less formal containing lower information content many pronouns written language particular differences magniﬁed written language compared spoken face-toface conversations multi-modal highly socially situated. biber finegan observed pronouns questions contradictions well that-clauses if-clauses appear high frequency face-to-face conversations. forchini summarized differences studies show face-to-face conversation interpersonal situation-dependent narrative concern biber finegan highly interactive situated immediate text type... differences spoken written language emphasize distinction dialogue corpora written spoken language following sections. similarly dialogues involving visual modalities differ dialogues without modalities visual modality available example human interlucators converse face-to-face body language gaze signiﬁcant impact said said aside visual modality dialogue systems also incorporate situational modalities including aspects virtual environments user proﬁles another important distinction dialogue datasets resides types interlocutors notably whether involves interactions humans human computer. distinction important current artiﬁcial dialogue systems signiﬁcantly constrained. contain distribution understanding errors human–human turn-taking much richer human-machine dialog. result human-machine dialogue exhibits different traits human-human dialogue goal-driven settings williams young previously argued building data-driven dialogue systems using human-human dialogues using human-human conversation data appropriate contain distribution understanding errors human-human turn-taking much richer human-machine dialog. line reasoning seems particularly applicable spoken dialogue systems speech recognition errors critical impact performance therefore must taken account learning dialogue model. argument also relevant goal-driven dialogue systems effective dialogue model often learned using reinforcement learning techniques. williams young also argue learning corpora generated humans existing dialogue systems while would possible corpus collected existing spoken dialogue system supervised learning would simply learn approximate policy used spoken dialogue system overall performance improvement would therefore unlikely. thus appears goal-driven spoken dialogue systems particular effective strategy learning online interaction real users. nonetheless exists useful human-machine corpora interacting machine uses stochastic policy generate sufﬁcient coverage task allow effective dialogue model learned. case goal learn policy eventually better original stochastic policy used generate corpus process known bootstrapping. survey focus data-driven learning human-human human-machine dialogue corpora. despite advantages learning online interactions real users learning based human-human dialogue corpora suitable open domain dialogue systems reﬂect natural dialogue interactions. natural dialogues mean conversations unconstrained unscripted e.g. interlocutors instructed carry particular task follow series instructions scripted dialogue. setting dialogue process relatively unaffected researchers e.g. interlocutors interrupted question prompts middle dialogue. expected conversations include signiﬁcant amount turn-taking pauses common grounding phenomena additionally diverse open possibility model learn understand natural language. dialogue corpus generated collected signiﬁcant inﬂuence trained data-driven dialogue system. case human-human dialogues ideal corpus closely resemble natural dialogues humans. arguably case conversations humans recorded transcribed humans dialogue represent true population users dialogue system intended interact. even better unaware fact recorded always possible ethical considerations resource constraints. ethical considerations resource constraints researchers forced inform human interlocutors recorded setup artiﬁcial experiments hire humans instruct carry particular task interacting dialogue system. cases guarantee interactions corpus reﬂect true interactions since hired humans behave differently true user population. factor cause behavioural differences fact hired humans share intentions motivations true user population unnaturalness exacerbated hiring process well platform interact. factors becoming prevalent researchers increasingly rely crowdsourcing platforms amazon mechanical turk collect evaluate dialogue data case wizard-of-oz experiments human thinks speaking machine human operator fact controlling dialogue system. enables generation datasets closer nature dialogues humans wish good dialogue system. unfortunately experiments expensive timeconsuming carry out. ultimately impact unnaturalness dialogues depends task context dialogue system deployed. also possible artiﬁcial dialogue corpora data-driven learning. includes corpora based works ﬁction novels movie manuscripts audio subtitles. however unlike transcribed human-human conversations novels movie manuscripts audio subtitles depend upon events outside current conversation observed. makes data-driven learning difﬁcult dialogue system account unknown factors. problem also observed certain media microblogging websites conversations also depend external unobserved events. nevertheless recent studies found spoken language movies resembles spontaneous human spoken language although movie dialogues explicitly written spoken contain certain artiﬁcial elements many linguistic paralinguistic features contained within dialogues similar natural spoken language including dialogue acts turn-taking reciprocity artiﬁcial differences exist even helpful data-driven dialogue learning since movie dialogues compact follow steady rhythm contain less garbling repetition still presenting clear event message viewer unlike dialogues extracted wizard-of-oz human experiments movie dialogues span many different topics occur many different environments contain different actors different intentions relationships another could potentially allow data-driven dialogue system learn personalize different users making different interaction patterns primary perspectives importance dataset size building data-driven dialogue systems. ﬁrst perspective comes machine learning literature larger datasets place constraints dialogue model trained data. datasets examples require strong structural priors placed model using modular system large datasets used train end-to-end dialogue systems less priori structure. second comes statistical natural language processing perspective since statistical complexity corpus grows linguistic diversity number topics number examples required machine learning algorithm model patterns also grow linguistic diversity number topics. consider small datasets number dialogues domain schedule information dataset conversations users operator natural operator improvise chitchat; dataset operator reads script provide information. despite size second dataset less linguistic diversity include chitchat topics. therefore easier train data-driven dialogue system mimcking behaviour operator second dataset however also exhibit highly pedantic style able chitchat. addition this effective discussion agents common knowledge must represented understood parties. process establishing common knowledge also known grounding especially critical repair misunderstandings humans dialogue systems since number misunderstandings grow lexical diversity number topics number examples required repair grow linguistic diversity topics. particular effect linguistic diversity observed practice vinyals train simple encoder-decoder neural network proprietary dataset technical support dialogues. although similar size purpose ubuntu dialogue corpus qualitative examples shown vinyals signiﬁcantly superior obtained complex models ubuntu corpus result likely explained part fact technical support operators often follow comprehensive script solving problems. such script would reduce linguistic diversity responses. furthermore since majority human-human dialogues multi-modal highly ambiguous nature size corpus compensate ambiguity missing modalities. corpus sufﬁciently large resolved ambiguities missing modalities example approximated using latent stochastic variables thus include corpus size dimension analysis. also discuss beneﬁts drawbacks several popular large-scale datasets section vast amount data available documenting human communication. much data could used perhaps pre-processing train dialogue system. however covering sources data would infeasible. thus restrict scope survey datasets already used study dialogue build dialogue systems large corpora interactions—that strictly considered dialogue datasets—which could leveraged near future build sophisticated data-driven dialogue models. restrict selection contain corpora generated spoken written english corpora which best knowledge either publicly available made available near future. ﬁrst give brief overview considered corpora later highlight promising examples explaining could used dialogue research. dialogue datasets analyzed paper listed tables column features indicate properties datasets including number dialogues average dialogue length number words whether interactions humans automated system whether dialogues written spoken. below discuss qualitative features datasets statistics found aforementioned table. discussed subsection important distinction dialogue datasets whether consist dialogues

environments. set-up forms basis corpus consists multi-party dialogue sessions approximately minutes each. cases discussion topics constrained certain political stances mock committees choosing candidates. interesting feature different participants given different roles—leader disruptor consensus builder—with general outline goals conversation. thus dataset could used model social phenomena agenda control inﬂuence leadership on-line interactions. largest written corpus constrained topic recently released ubuntu dialogue corpus almost million dialogues turns more related former ubuntu chat corpus million words. corpora scraped ubuntu channel logs. channel users question problem ubuntu; questions answered users. although chat room allows everyone chat multi-party setting ubuntu dialogue corpus uses series heuristics disentangle dyadic dialogue. technical nature size corpus lends particularly well applications technical support. corpora extracted chat logs. corpus contains approximately hours chat estimated utterances linux channel complete posting times. therefore dataset consists similarly technical conversations ubuntu corpus occasional social chat. purpose dataset investigate approaches conversation disentanglement; given multi-party chat room attempts recover individual conversations composed. purpose approximately utterances annotated ground-truth conversations. recent efforts combined traditional conversational corpora question answering recommendation datasets order facilitate construction goal-driven dialogue systems. case movie dialog dataset four tasks authors propose prerequisite working dialogue system question answering recommendation question answering recommendation casual conversation. movie dialog dataset consists four sub-datasets used training models complete tasks dataset open movie database examples accompanying movie actor metadata form knowledge triples; recommendation dataset movielens users questions; combined recommendation dataset conversations turns each; discussion dataset reddit’s movie subreddit. former evaluated using recall metrics manner similar lowe noted that reddit dataset dialogues sub-datasets simulated pairs response corresponds list entities knowledge base. conclude discussing number general issues related development evaluation data-driven dialogue systems. also discuss alternative sources information user personalization automatic evaluation methods. recently several large-scale dialogue datasets proposed order train data-driven dialogue systems; twitter corpus ubuntu dialogue corpus examples. section discuss beneﬁts drawbacks datasets based experience using building data-driven models. unlike previous twitter corpus consists series conversations extracted tweets. dataset large general-purpose micro-blogging nature source material leads several drawbacks building conversational dialogue agents. however drawbacks apply goal build agent interacts users twitter platform. twitter corpus enormous amount typos slang abbreviations. -character limit tweets often short compressed. addition users frequently twitter-speciﬁc devices hashtags. unless building dialogue agent speciﬁcally twitter often desirable chatbot hashtags excessive abbreviations reﬂective humans converse environments. also results signiﬁcant increase word vocabulary required dialogue systems trained word level. such surprising character-level models shown promising results twitter twitter conversations often contain various kinds verbal role-playing imaginative actions similar stage directions theater plays conversations different majority textbased chats. therefore dialogue models trained dataset often able provide interesting accurate responses contexts involving role-playing imaginative actions another challenge posed twitter twitter conversations often refer recent public events outside conversation. order learn effective responses conversations dialogue agent must infer news event discussion referencing form external knowledge base. would appear particularly difﬁcult task. ubuntu dialogue corpus largest publicly available datasets containing technical support dialogues. commercial importance systems dataset attracted signiﬁcant attention. thus ubuntu dialogue corpus presents opportunity anyone train large-scale data-driven technical support dialogue systems. despite this several problems training data-driven dialogue models ubuntu dialogue corpus nature data. first since corpus comes multiparty channel needs disentangled separate dialogues. disentanglement process noisy errors inevitably arise. frequent error missing utterance dialogue picked extraction procedure result substantial amount conversations difﬁcult follow topic. particular means next utterance classiﬁcation examples models must select correct next response list candidates either difﬁcult impossible models predict. another problem arises lack annotations labels. since users solve technical problems perhaps best build models goal-driven dialogue framework dialogue system maximize probability solve user’s problem conversation. however reward labels available. thus difﬁcult model dataset goal-driven dialogue framework. future work alleviate constructing automatic methods determining whether user particular conversation solved problem. particular challenge ubuntu dialogue corpus large number out-of-vocabulary words including many technical words related ubuntu operating system commands software packages websites etc. since words occur rarely dataset difﬁcult learn meaning directly dataset example difﬁcult obtain meaningful distributed real-valued vector representations neural network-based dialogue models. exacerbated large number users different nomenclature acronyms speaking styles many typos dataset. thus linguistic diversity corpus large. ﬁnal challenge dataset necessity additional knowledge related ubuntu order accurately generate predict next response conversation. hypothesize knowledge crucial system trained ubuntu dialogue corpus effective practice often solutions technical problems change time versions operating system become available. thus effective dialogue system must learn combine up-to-date technical information understanding natural language dialogue order solve users’ problems. discuss external knowledge detail section challenges make difﬁcult build data-driven dialogue systems also presents important research opportunity. current data-driven dialogue systems perform rather poorly terms generating utterances coherent on-topic such signiﬁcant room improvement models. always feasible obtain large corpora every application related datasets effectively bootstrap learning process. several branches machine learning particular deep learning related datasets pre-training model effective method scaling complex environments build open-domain dialogue systems arguably necessary move beyond domainspeciﬁc datasets. instead like humans dialogue systems trained multiple data sources solving multiple tasks. leverage statistical efﬁciency necessary ﬁrst unsupervised learning—as opposed supervised learning ofﬂine reinforcement learning typically provide sparse scalar feedback signal phrase sequence phrases—and ﬁne-tune models based human feedback. researchers already proposed various ways applying transfer learning build data-driven dialogue systems ranging learning separate sub-components dialogue system learning entire dialogue system using transfer learning tables list topics available datasets. several human-human datasets denoted casual unrestricted topics. contrast human-machine datasets focus speciﬁc narrow topics. useful keep distinction restricted unrestricted topics mind goal-driven dialogue systems typically well-deﬁned measure performance related task completion usually developed former setting. cases line types datasets blurs. example case conversations occurring players online game outcome game determined participants play game environment conversation. case conversations direct impact player’s performance game conversations related game irrelevant goal conversations completly unrelated game. recently signiﬁcant progress made towards incorporating form external memory various neural-network architectures sequence modeling. models memory networks neural turing machines store part input memory reasoned order perform variety sequence sequence tasks. vary simple problems sequence copying complex problems question answering machine translation. although none models explicitly designed address dialogue problems extension kumar dynamic memory networks speciﬁcally differentiates episodic semantic memory. case episodic memory memory used traditional memory networks paper extracted input semantic memory refers knowledge sources ﬁxed inputs. model shown work variety tasks difﬁcult envision application dialogue utterance generation semantic memory desired external knowledge source. another interesting research direction incorporation external knowledge sources order inform response generated. using external information great importance dialogues systems particularly goal-driven setting. even non-goal-driven dialogue systems designed simply entertain user could beneﬁt leveraging external information current news articles movie reviews order better converse real-world events. particularly useful data-sparse domains enough dialogue training data reliably learn response appropriate input utterance domains evolve quickly time. traditional goal-driven dialogue systems goal provide information user already extensive external knowledge sources. example let’s dialogue system user requests information various arrival departure times. thus critical input model actual schedule used order generate system’s utterances. another example dialogue system described n¨oth helps users movie information utilizing movie showtimes different cinemas. examples abundant literature practice. although models make external knowledge knowledge sources cases highly structured used place hard constraints possible states utterance generated. essentially contained relational databases structured ontologies used provide deterministic mapping dialogue states extracted input user utterance dialogue system state generated response. complementary domain-speciﬁc databases ontologies general natural language processing databases tools. include lexical databases wordnet contains lexical relationships words hundred thousand words verbnet contains lexical relations verbs framenet contains ’word senses’ thousand words along examples word sense. addition exist several natural language processing tools part speech taggers word category classiﬁers word embedding models named entity recognition models coreference resolution models semantic role labeling models semantic similarity models sentiment analysis models used natural language interpreter extract meaning human utterances. since tools typically built upon texts annotations created humans using inside dialogue system interpreted form structured transfer learning relationships labels learned original natural language processing corpus provide additional information dialogue system improve generalization system. complementary sources information found unstructured knowledge sources online encyclopedias well domain-speciﬁc sources beyond scope paper review possible ways unstructured knowledge sources could used conjunction data-driven dialogue system. however note likely fruitful research area. conversing humans often adapt interlocutor facilitate understanding thus improve conversational efﬁciency satisfaction. attaining human-level performance dialogue agents well require personalization i.e. models aware capable adapting intelocutor. capabilities could increase effectiveness naturalness generated dialogues personalization dialogue systems important task received much attention. initial efforts userspeciﬁc models could adapted work combination dialogue models presented survey also interesting work character modeling movies signiﬁcant potential learn user models part dialogue models. large datasets presented paper provide multiple dialogues user enable development models. challenging aspects constructing dialogue systems lies evaluation. goal deploy dialogue system application setting receive real human feedback getting stage time consuming expensive. often also necessary optimize performance pseudo-performance metric prior release. particularly true dialogue model many hyper-parameters optimized—it infeasible user experiments every parameter setting grid search. although crowdsourcing platforms amazon mechanical turk used user testing evaluations using paid subjects also lead biased results ideally would automated metrics calculating score model involve human evaluators best model chosen reasonable conﬁdence. evaluation problem also arises non-goal-driven dialogue systems. here researchers focused mainly output response generation module. evaluation non-goaldriven dialogue systems traced back turing test human judges communicate computer programs humans chat terminal without knowing other’s true identity. goal judges identify humans computer programs assumption program indistinguishable real human must intelligent. however setup criticized extensively numerous researchers proposing alternative evaluation procedures recently researchers turned analyzing collected dialogues produced ﬁnished even human evaluators available often difﬁcult choose informative consistent criteria used judge utterance generated dialogue system. example might evaluator rate utterance vague notions ‘appropriateness’ ‘naturalness’ differentiate utterances generated system generated actual humans schatzmann suggest aspects need evaluated response generation systems model generate human-like output model reproduce variety user behaviour found corpus. lack deﬁnitive framework evaluations. user evaluation goal-driven dialogue systems typically focuses goal-related performance criteria goal completion rate dialogue length user satisfaction originally evaluated human users interacting dialogue system recently researchers also begun third-party annotators evaluating recorded dialogues simplicity vast majority handcrafted task-oriented dialogue systems solely evaluated way. however using machine learning algorithms train large-scale corpora automatic optimization criteria required. challenge evaluating goal-driven dialogue systems without human intervention process necessarily requires multiple steps—it difﬁcult determine task solved single utterance-response pair conversation. thus simulated data often generated user simulator given sufﬁciently accurate user simulation model interaction dialogue system user simulated possible deduce desired metrics goal completion rate. signiﬁcant effort made render simulated data realistic possible modeling user intentions. evaluation simulation methods already conducted however generating realistic user simulation models remains open problem. word overlap metrics. approach borrow evaluation metrics tasks machine translation uses bleu meteor scores. metrics used compare responses generated learned dialogue strategy actual next utterance conversation conditioned dialogue context bleu scores shown correlate human judgements machine translation effectiveness automatically assessing dialogue response generation unclear. several issues consider given context conversation often exists large number possible responses ‘ﬁt’ dialogue. thus response generated dialogue system could entirely reasonable words common actual next utterance. case bleu score would would accurately reﬂect strength model. indeed even humans tasked predicting next utterance conversation achieve relatively bleu scores although meteor metric takes account synonyms morphological variants words candidate response still suffers aforementioned problems. sense measurements satisfy direction schatzmann’s criteria high bleu meteor scores imply model generating human-like output model still reproduce variety user behaviour found corpus. furthermore metrics accurately reﬂect performance dialogue system given large number candidate responses given context. next utterance classiﬁcation. alternatively narrow number possible responses small pre-deﬁned list model select appropriate response list. list includes actual next response conversation entries sampled elsewhere corpus next utterance classiﬁcation task derived recall precision metrics information-retrieval-based approaches. several attractive properties metric easy interpret difﬁculty adjusted changing number false responses. however drawbacks. particular since candidate answers sampled elsewhere corpus chance also represent reasonable responses given context. alleviated extent reporting recallk measures i.e. whether correct response found responses highest rankings according model. although current models evaluated using trained explicitly maximize performance metric minimizing cross-entropy context-response pairs metric could also used evaluate probabilistic generative model trained output full utterances. word perplexity. another metric proposed evaluate probabilistic language models seen signiﬁcant recent evaluating end-to-end dialogue systems word perplexity perplexity explicitly measures probability model generate ground truth next utterance given context conversation. particularly appealing dialogue distribution words next utterance highly multi-modal re-weighted perplexity metric also proposed stop-words punctuation end-of-utterance tokens removed evaluating focus semantic content phrase word perplexity well utterance-level recall precision outlined above satisfy schatzmann’s evaluation criteria since scoring high would require model produce human-like output reproduce types conversations corpus. response diversity. recent non-goal-driven dialogue systems based neural networks problems generating diverse responses recently introduced metrics distinct- distinct- respectively measure number distinct unigrams bigrams generated responses. although fail satisfy either schatzmann’s criteria still useful combination metrics bleu word perplexity. strong evidence next years dialogue research quickly move towards large-scale data-driven model approaches. particular case language-related applications speech recognition machine translation information retrieval approaches likely come form end-to-end trainable systems. paper provides extensive survey currently available datasets suitable research development evaluation data-driven dialogue systems. addition presenting datasets provide detailed discussion several issues related datasets dialogue system research. several
