{"title": "Augmentor: An Image Augmentation Library for Machine Learning", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "The generation of artificial data based on existing observations, known as data augmentation, is a technique used in machine learning to improve model accuracy, generalisation, and to control overfitting. Augmentor is a software package, available in both Python and Julia versions, that provides a high level API for the expansion of image data using a stochastic, pipeline-based approach which effectively allows for images to be sampled from a distribution of augmented images at runtime. Augmentor provides methods for most standard augmentation practices as well as several advanced features such as label-preserving, randomised elastic distortions, and provides many helper functions for typical augmentation tasks used in machine learning.", "text": "generation artiﬁcial data based existing observations known data augmentation technique used machine learning improve model accuracy
