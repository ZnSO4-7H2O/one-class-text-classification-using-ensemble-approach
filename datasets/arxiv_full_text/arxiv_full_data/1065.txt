{"title": "Toward the automated analysis of complex diseases in genome-wide  association studies using genetic programming", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.LG", "q-bio.QM", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Machine learning has been gaining traction in recent years to meet the demand for tools that can efficiently analyze and make sense of the ever-growing databases of biomedical data in health care systems around the world. However, effectively using machine learning methods requires considerable domain expertise, which can be a barrier of entry for bioinformaticians new to computational data science methods. Therefore, off-the-shelf tools that make machine learning more accessible can prove invaluable for bioinformaticians. To this end, we have developed an open source pipeline optimization tool (TPOT-MDR) that uses genetic programming to automatically design machine learning pipelines for bioinformatics studies. In TPOT-MDR, we implement Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) as a feature construction method for modeling higher-order feature interactions, and combine it with a new expert knowledge-guided feature selector for large biomedical data sets. We demonstrate TPOT-MDR's capabilities using a combination of simulated and real world data sets from human genetics and find that TPOT-MDR significantly outperforms modern machine learning methods such as logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We further analyze the best pipeline discovered by TPOT-MDR for a real world problem and highlight TPOT-MDR's ability to produce a high-accuracy solution that is also easily interpretable.", "text":

using expert knowledge sources combining information diﬀerent expert knowledge sources modeling higher-order interactions features using multifactor dimensionality reduction predict patient’s outcome. before bioinformaticians would typically perform reﬁne operations hand whereas tpot-mdr relieve bioinformatician tedious duties focus challenging tasks. even though paper focuses application tpot-mdr gwas datasets note tpot-mdr general machine learning tool work dataset categorical features binary outcome. tpot-mdr released free open source python tool available github. section evaluated tpot-mdr series simulated real-world gwas datasets found tpot-mdr outperforms linear models xgboost across datasets ﬁndings important several reasons. demonstrated simple linear models ill-suited analysis gwas datasets owing inability model higherorder interactions within dataset. also demonstrated state-of-the-art tree-based machine learning methods— typically thought eﬀective modeling higher-order feature interactions—are similarly ill-suited modeling gwas datasets large numbers features. finally highlighted importance harnessing priori expert knowledge ﬁlter gwas datasets prior modeling step could state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms xgboost eliminating extraneous features. although results section suggest tpot-mdr superior compared methods every dataset used drawbacks tpot-mdr must considered. linear models xgboost orders magnitude faster train evaluate tpot-mdr. tpot-mdr uses genetic programming optimize series ﬁltering modeling operations dataset single tpot-mdr took roughly hours cgems dataset whereas xgboost logistic regression took less minute. given many gwas datasets often thousands hundreds thousands features tpot-mdr require work improve time scalability larger gwas datasets. furthermore tpot-mdr highly dependent expert knowledge sources. experiments used expert knowledge sources specialize detecting higherorder epistatic interactions proved critical simulated real world datasets. tpot-mdr provided less informative expert knowledge sources likely perform worse observe figures shown figure xgboost sometimes model higher-order interactions dataset heavily ﬁltered beforehand. however resulting xgboost model nearly interpretable tpot-mdr. tpot-mdr produces model inspect study pattern feature interactions within dataset whereas xgboost provides complex ensemble decision trees. important consideration building machine learning tools bioinformatics often bioinformaticians need black model achieves high prediction accuracy real-world dataset. instead bioinformaticians seek build model used microscope understanding underlying biology system modeling. regard models generated tpot-mdr invaluable elucidating higher-order interactions often present complex biological systems. conclusion tpot-mdr promising step forward using evolutionary algorithms automate design machine learning workﬂows bioinformaticians. believe evolutionary
