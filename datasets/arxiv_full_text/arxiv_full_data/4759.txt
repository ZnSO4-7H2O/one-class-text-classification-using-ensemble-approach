Machine learning is a form of computational fixed point iteration, iterating over the computable function space. We showcase some properties of this iteration, and establish in general that the iteration is 'almost surely' of chaotic nature. This theory explains the observation in the counter intuitive properties of deep learning methods. This paper demonstrates that these properties are going to be universal to any learning method.", "text": "abstract. demonstrated earlier universal computation ‘alsurely’ chaotic. machine learning form computational ﬁxed point iteration iterating computable function space. showcase properties iteration establish general iteration ‘almost surely’ chaotic nature. theory explains observation counter intuitive properties deep learning methods. paper demonstrates properties going universal learning method. motivation current paper fold. authors current paper using iterative machine learning crack cipher code late came astounding realisation resulting learned function convergent all. really meant data points accepted up-to iteration would away eventually iteration essence iteration showing converging sudden diverging behaviour. communicated ﬁnding pioneers image processing domain simply baﬄed. fact trivia simply remarked idea respond. behavior never fully nabarun mondal dedicated missing geometry teacher sushanta mondal; parents tapan sabita mondal; thanks abhishek chanda shweta bansal constant support. simply suggest machine learning ﬁnding positive samples sets indicator function formulation problem really know whether computable. computable functions paper would designated assume existence sequence computable functions converges function approximation decision whether therefore clearly partitions input space question mechanism computable partitioning requires deﬁnition. given input current node input rejected system halted. input accepted system halted. passed input left child left child exists reject input halt. passed input right child right child exists reject input halt. given universal turing machine computable function encoded using symbols tape machine. rationalisation tape then serves rationalisation computable function. cardinality equal continuum |{lim well known theorem real analysis irrational numbers take inﬁnitely many symbols encode therefore function limit encoded turing machine tape hence obviously computable. proof. note every node tree ﬁrst transform input space using homeomorphic that space partitioned using ﬁnite number discussed section individual partitions homeomorphic suppose deﬁnes number partitions. numbers homeomorphic non-surjective function available lemma proof. almost surely function un-computable note ﬁxed size learner algorithm number deciders learning system stays ﬁnite. therefore convergent structure extended inﬁnity inﬁnite binary decision tree using theorem result immediate. theorems proven sections useful deduce interesting properties machine learning clearly showcases problems arising chaotic nature universal computation. ﬁrst phenomenon converging process experienced co-author clearly explained inherent chaotic nature iteration. functions encoded rational space almost surely chaotic orbit output function drastically diﬀer given input. however well know although almost numbers normal transcendental proving problem problem here. proving speciﬁc behaviour chaotic done case case basis. second phenomenon reported stated clearly algorithm diﬀerent subset original training facing problem. happening case iteration actually converging generating fractal partition input space precisely found input output mapping mostly discontinuous also noted input gets accepted dense inputs gets rejected. standard property fractal space summarise iteration converges result would ‘almost surely’ fractal set. iteration diﬀerent initial conditions would fact converge diﬀerent indicator function hence would accept diﬀerent given metric space sequence real numbers called ‘cauchy sequence’ every positive real number positive integer natural numbers following holds-", "year": 2014}
