{"title": "Learning to Rank based on Analogical Reasoning", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Object ranking or \"learning to rank\" is an important problem in the realm of preference learning. On the basis of training data in the form of a set of rankings of objects represented as feature vectors, the goal is to learn a ranking function that predicts a linear order of any new set of objects. In this paper, we propose a new approach to object ranking based on principles of analogical reasoning. More specifically, our inference pattern is formalized in terms of so-called analogical proportions and can be summarized as follows: Given objects $A,B,C,D$, if object $A$ is known to be preferred to $B$, and $C$ relates to $D$ as $A$ relates to $B$, then $C$ is (supposedly) preferred to $D$. Our method applies this pattern as a main building block and combines it with ideas and techniques from instance-based learning and rank aggregation. Based on first experimental results for data sets from various domains (sports, education, tourism, etc.), we conclude that our approach is highly competitive. It appears to be specifically interesting in situations in which the objects are coming from different subdomains, and which hence require a kind of knowledge transfer.", "text": "number different ranking problems already introduced. based type training data required predictions f¨urnkranz h¨ullermeier distinguish problems object ranking label ranking instance ranking focus paper object ranking. given training data form exemplary rankings subsets objects goal object ranking learn ranking function able predict ranking objects. main contribution novel approach based idea analogical reasoning essentially builds following inference pattern object relates object relates knowing preferred infer preferred figure provides illustration cars objects. cars less same except cabriolet color instead black true cars thus knowing someone likes conjecture person prefers method applies pattern main building block combines ideas techniques instance-based learning rank aggregation. object ranking learning rank important problem realm preference learning. basis training data form rankings objects represented feature vectors goal learn ranking function predicts linear order objects. paper propose approach object ranking based principles analogical reasoning. speciﬁcally inference pattern formalized terms so-called analogical proportions summarized follows given objects object known preferred relates relates preferred method applies pattern main building block combines ideas techniques instance-based learning rank aggregation. based ﬁrst experimental results data sets various domains conclude approach highly competitive. appears speciﬁcally interesting situations objects coming different subdomains hence require kind knowledge transfer. preference learning received increasing attention machine learning recent years roughly speaking goal preference learning induce preference models observational data reveal information preferences individual group individuals direct indirect way;

principle different speciﬁcations could even used source target. experiments conducted paper kind knowledge transfer already required source target still closely related essentially domain. already said plan extend experiments toward problems source target different domains generalize ablerank correspondingly. besides basic version ablerank presented paper ought improved extended different directions. example time being analogical proportion feature vectors ablerank simply average analogical proportions individual attributes. however since different features different inﬂuence preferences analogies selection weighting features appears quite important. therefore development methods feature selection weighting addressed future work. furthermore current version ablerank ignores possible interactions features. example person prefer color black t-shirts preference might reversed case pullovers. learning interactions capturing analogical inference highly non-trivial problem. last least issues related computational efﬁciency ought addressed. since ablerank follows lazy learning paradigm like instance-based learning nearest neighbor prediction learn easily relatively costly prediction time. comparison nearest neighbor classiﬁcation example cost even higher need iterate pairs objects training data highest analogical proportions. thus implementing highest analogy search naive complexity scales quadratically size training data. consequently need reduce complexity means suitable data structures algorithms efﬁcient retrieval analogy pairs. besides means complexity reduction could considered instance selection editing strategies like used case-based reasoning", "year": 2017}
