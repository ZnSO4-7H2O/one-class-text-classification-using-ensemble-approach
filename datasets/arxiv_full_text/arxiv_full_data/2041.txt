{"title": "A Variational Approximation for Bayesian Networks with Discrete and  Continuous Latent Variables", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We show how to use a variational approximation to the logistic function to perform approximate inference in Bayesian networks containing discrete nodes with continuous parents. Essentially, we convert the logistic function to a Gaussian, which facilitates exact inference, and then iteratively adjust the variational parameters to improve the quality of the approximation. We demonstrate experimentally that this approximation is faster and potentially more accurate than sampling. We also introduce a simple new technique for handling evidence, which allows us to handle arbitrary distributions on observed nodes, as well as achieving a significant speedup in networks with discrete variables of large cardinality.", "text": "show variational logistic inference crete nodes continuous convert function facilitates adjust tively quality experimentally comparable faster also introduce simple allows handling distributions bitrary observed achieving speedup discrete scribing nodes hybrid networks. give brief overview sections specific variational approach cuss computational section sults assess quality discussing future introduction many probabilistic continuous \"hybrid\".) continuous discrete continuous ena) standard ables -plogp binary tropy function. lower bound tighter learning lower bound likelihood upper bound used conjunction lower bound filter runs mcmc result bounds approach handling evidence \"traditional\" approach evidence tion tree framework start discrete. initialized evidence clique form i'th position. sets entries evidence. finally global clique variables normalized likelihood posterior approach eviÂ­ dence incremental arrives cannot tree instead rerun whole inference approach evidence. technique handled soft evidence instantiate computational possible potential (i.e. operations number entries number discrete large cliques contain solve large linear people models without kinds approximations bayes community.", "year": 2013}
