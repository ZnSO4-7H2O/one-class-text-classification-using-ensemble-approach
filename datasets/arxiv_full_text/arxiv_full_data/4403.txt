{"title": "Real-Time Background Subtraction Using Adaptive Sampling and Cascade of  Gaussians", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "Background-Foreground classification is a fundamental well-studied problem in computer vision. Due to the pixel-wise nature of modeling and processing in the algorithm, it is usually difficult to satisfy real-time constraints. There is a trade-off between the speed (because of model complexity) and accuracy. Inspired by the rejection cascade of Viola-Jones classifier, we decompose the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) into an adaptive cascade of classifiers. This way we achieve a good improvement in speed without compensating for accuracy. In the training phase, we learn multiple KDEs for different durations to be used as strong prior distribution and detect probable oscillating pixels which usually results in misclassifications. We propose a confidence measure for the classifier based on temporal consistency and the prior distribution. The confidence measure thus derived is used to adapt the learning rate and the thresholds of the model, to improve accuracy. The confidence measure is also employed to perform temporal and spatial sampling in a principled way. We demonstrate a speed-up factor of 5x to 10x and 17 percent average improvement in accuracy over several standard videos.", "text": "background-foreground classiﬁcation fundamental well-studied
