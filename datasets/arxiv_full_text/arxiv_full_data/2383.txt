{"title": "ExpertBayes: Automatically refining manually built Bayesian networks", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Bayesian network structures are usually built using only the data and starting from an empty network or from a naive Bayes structure. Very often, in some domains, like medicine, a prior structure knowledge is already known. This structure can be automatically or manually refined in search for better performance models. In this work, we take Bayesian networks built by specialists and show that minor perturbations to this original network can yield better classifiers with a very small computational cost, while maintaining most of the intended meaning of the original model.", "text": "abstract. bayesian network structures usually built using data starting empty network na¨ıve bayes structure. often domains
