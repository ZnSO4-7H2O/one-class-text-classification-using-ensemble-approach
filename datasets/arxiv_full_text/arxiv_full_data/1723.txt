{"title": "The Bayesian Echo Chamber: Modeling Social Influence via Linguistic  Accommodation", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SI"], "abstract": "We present the Bayesian Echo Chamber, a new Bayesian generative model for social interaction data. By modeling the evolution of people's language usage over time, this model discovers latent influence relationships between them. Unlike previous work on inferring influence, which has primarily focused on simple temporal dynamics evidenced via turn-taking behavior, our model captures more nuanced influence relationships, evidenced via linguistic accommodation patterns in interaction content. The model, which is based on a discrete analog of the multivariate Hawkes process, permits a fully Bayesian inference algorithm. We validate our model's ability to discover latent influence patterns using transcripts of arguments heard by the US Supreme Court and the movie \"12 Angry Men.\" We showcase our model's capabilities by using it to infer latent influence patterns from Federal Open Market Committee meeting transcripts, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance at uncovering social dynamics in group discussions.",

consists chief justice eight associate justices. oral argument heard court therefore involves nine justices plus attorneys representing petitioner respondent. format argument formulaic attorneys party minutes present argument representing petitioner speaking ﬁrst. justices routinely interrupt attorneys’ presentations make comments questions attorneys. sometimes additional attorneys known amicae curae also present arguments support either petitioner respondent. used time-stamped transcripts three controversial supreme court cases lawrence garner texas district columbia heller citizens united federal election commission angry movie jury’s deliberations regarding guilt acquittal defendant. unlike supreme court arguments dialog informal intended seem natural. movie unique limited cast people

comparatively taciturn. jurors exerts little inﬂuence must respond questions defend position tries persuade others agree much like attorneys supreme court. open market committee meetings surrounding ﬁnancial crisis ranging march december inclusive. since utterance durations available transcripts duration utterance value proportional length tokens. divided meetings three subsets march june august august august december ﬁrst subset corresponds meetings resultant policy tightening; second meetings neutral outcome; third meetings resulted easing. meetings chaired bernanke. figure depicts inﬂuence network subset inferred using model. ﬁrst network corresponding pre-crash meetings march june bernanke fisher lacker play biggest roles bernanke chair exerting inﬂuence others. given role chair bernanke’s involvement arguably unsurprising fisher lacker’s roles notable. unlike bernanke fisher lacker hawks thus generally favor tightening monetary policy; meetings subset resulted outcome tightening. second network corresponding pre-crash meetings august august bernanke fisher lacker continue play signiﬁcant roles network much less sparse hawks doves exerting inﬂuence others. contrast meetings previous subset meetings resulted neutrality—i.e. neither tightening easing. finally third network corresponding postcrash meetings august december fewer strong inﬂuence relationships. bernanke still plays major role fisher lacker’s roles signiﬁcantly diminished. instead dudley also dove close ally bernanke plays much greater role especially relationship bernanke. meetings resulted monetary policy easing strategy generally favored doves opposed hawks. tied parameters extremely similar inferred using bayesian echo chamber. results suggest linguistic accommodation reﬂects informative notion inﬂuence evidenced turn-taking. expect investigating ways combining turn-taking-based models promising direction future exploration. little work political science economics computer science analyzing meeting transcripts. result inferred networks showcase model’s ability discover latent inﬂuence relationships linguistic accommodation also constitute research contribution substantive interest political scientists economists social scientists studying ﬁnancial crisis. since inﬂuence inferred turn-taking behavior linguistic accommodation explored possibility combining bayesian echo chamber blundell al.’s model form supermodel single shared inﬂuence parameters. simplest share parameters together scaling factor correspond inﬂuence person person model blundell al.’s
