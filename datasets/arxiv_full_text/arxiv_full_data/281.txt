{"title": "A Multi-World Approach to Question Answering about Real-World Scenes  based on Uncertain Input", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We propose a method for automatically answering questions about images by bringing together recent advances from natural language processing and computer vision. We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a multi-world approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a bayesian framework. Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts, object classes, instances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test.", "text": "propose method automatically answering questions images bringing together recent
