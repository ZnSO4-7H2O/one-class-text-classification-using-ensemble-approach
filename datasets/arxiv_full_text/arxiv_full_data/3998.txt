Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor based feature sets extracted from fingerprint and ear are fused. The fused set is encoded by K-medoids partitioning approach with less number of feature points in the set. K-medoids partition the whole dataset into clusters to minimize the error between data points belonging to the clusters and its center. Reduced feature set is used to match between two biometric sets. Matching scores are generated using wolf-lamb user-dependent feature weighting scheme introduced by Doddington. The technique is tested to exhibit its robust performance.", "text": "abstract. paper presents multimodal biometric system fingerprint biometrics. scale invariant feature transform descriptor based
