{"title": "An Approach to the Analysis of the South Slavic Medieval Labels Using  Image Texture", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.4; I.2.7"], "abstract": "The paper presents a new script classification method for the discrimination of the South Slavic medieval labels. It consists in the textural analysis of the script types. In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent script type, which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded text is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent local binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes the feature classification more effective. It is the basis for the classification process of the script identification by using an extension of a state-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is evaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper labels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate very positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "text": "natural scene images include short text information background. important part scenes

accomplishes task multi-stage procedure. algorithm consists following stages horizontal projection proﬁle text distinct different text lines distribution blob heights center point classiﬁcation according typographical features mapping according script types creating equivalent image pattern features extraction image pattern according texture analysis classiﬁcation extracted features. beginning suppose skew identiﬁcation correction previously carried out. hence scope proposed algorithm. ﬁrst stage proposed algorithm represents extraction typographical features text image. includes three aforementioned steps given horizontal projection proﬁle text distinct diﬀerent text lines distribution blob heights center point classiﬁcation according typographical features. hence algorithm starts horizontal projection proﬁles deﬁne text line position. then blob extraction classiﬁed according previous text line segmentation. fig. shows initial text well blob segmentation bounding extraction procedure. then bounding used extract height center point fig. shows character heights distribution given bounding boxes. according typographical features letter divided following letter groups base letter ascender letter descendent letter full letter. fig. illustrates groups letters. fig. easy realize exist three diﬀerent letter heights. obviously base letters smallest heights full letters tallest heights. furthermore ascender descendent letters characterize similar heights base full letters. fig. illustrates center point diﬀerent script types. diﬀerent script types recognized diﬀerent center positions. although base full letter similar position center point i.e. close center position text line recognized diﬀerent heights. furthermore ascender letter center point upper part text line descendent letter center point lower part text line. hence diﬀerentiate easily spite similar heights. second stage algorithm represents mapping according script types creating equivalent image pattern. hence obtained division letters base ascender descendent full letters mapped coded text corresponds image texture. following mapping carried base letter ascender letter descendent

coded text given image. hence neighborhood includes instead pixels. leads total diﬀerent labels problem persists small number extracted features analysis. hence extension original operator eligible. ref. introduces combination subsets. represent called adjacent local binary pattern considers four pixels i.e. adjacent pixels horizontal adjacent pixels vertical directions. examines four diagonal
