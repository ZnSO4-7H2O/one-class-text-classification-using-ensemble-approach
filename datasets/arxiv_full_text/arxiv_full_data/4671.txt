Prior ACT-R models of acquiring task knowledge from instruction focused on learning procedural knowledge from declarative instructions encoded in semantic memory.

model of learning from situated interactive instruc- tion that is implemented in the Soar cognitive architecture.", "text": "learning novel tasks complex cognitive activity requiring learner acquire
