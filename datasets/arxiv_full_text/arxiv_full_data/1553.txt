{"title": "Past, Present, Future: A Computational Investigation of the Typology of  Tense in 1000 Languages", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We present SuperPivot, an analysis method for low-resource languages that occur in a superparallel corpus, i.e., in a corpus that contains an order of magnitude more languages than parallel corpora currently in use. We show that SuperPivot performs well for the crosslingual analysis of the linguistic phenomenon of tense. We produce analysis results for more than 1000 languages, conducting - to the best of our knowledge - the largest crosslingual computational study performed to date. We extend existing methodology for leveraging parallel corpora for typological analysis by overcoming a limiting assumption of earlier work: We only require that a linguistic feature is overtly marked in a few of thousands of languages as opposed to requiring that it be marked in all languages under investigation.", "text": "address challenge proposing method analyzing call superparallel corpora

hundred languages. means majority languages world low-resource. lowresource languages like fulani spoken tens millions people politically economically important; e.g. manage sudden refugee crisis tools would great beneﬁt. even small languages important preservation common heritage humankind includes natural remedies linguistic cultural diversity potentially enrich everybody. thus developing analysis methods low-resource languages important challenges today. goal head language head pivot perfect marker head pivot probably exist; precisely linguistic features completely rigorously deﬁned. sense signiﬁcant contributions work provide rigorous deﬁnitions past tense across languages; e.g. rigorous deﬁnition past tense automatically extends languages superparallel corpus. projection head pivot larger pivot set. based alignment head language languages superparallel corpus project head pivot languages search highly correlated surface markers i.e. search additional pivots languages. projection pivots achieves three goals. first makes method robust. relying single pivot would result many errors inherent noisiness linguistic data several components imperfect. second discussed above head pivot necessarily high recall; example applied certain clauses would translated using present perfect english. thus moving larger pivot increases recall. third below pivot leveraged create ﬁne-grained linguistic feature. consider clauses referring eventualities past english speakers would render past progressive present perfect simple past tense. hope pivot cover distinctions i.e. pivots marks past progressive present prefect simple past another pivot marks present perfect beyond scope paper verify produce analysis linguistic features promising example type including distinctions like progressive perfective aspect given running example compute correlation words languages select highest correlated words pivots. examples pivots torres strait creole tzotzil laj. perfective marker e.g. meltzaj ‘laj be-made subj’ means it’s done built projection pivot languages. large pivot project pivots languages search linguistic devices express linguistic feature point made assumption easy segment text languages pieces size small large segmentation standard delimiters good approximation majority languages undersegments oversegments others reason employ tokenization step. rather search character ngrams linguistic devices express implementation search procedure limitation many linguistic devices cannot found using e.g. templates templatic morphology. leave addressing future work linguistic analysis. result previous steps superparallel corpus richly annotated information linguistic feature structure exploited analysis single language focus linguistic investigation. starting character n-grams found step projection pivot languages explore function mined n-gram english many languages provide annotations linguistic also structure generated typological analysis

identify non-tokenizationbased character n-gram features step immediate challenge without tokens alignment languages anymore. could simply assume occurrence pivot scope entire verse. clearly inadequate e.g. sentence arrived yesterday staying today leave tomorrow incorrect marked past tense entirety. fortunately verses testament mostly simple structure limits variation particular piece content occurs verse. therefore make assumption particular relative position language aligned relative position likely work simple example like arrived yesterday staying today leave tomorrow across languages. analysis errors found many cases assumption breaks down. wellknown problematic phenomenon method difference between languages ﬁrst class puts verb beginning second end. however keep mind accumulate evidence pivots compute aggregate statistics entire corpus. evaluation shows linear alignment assumption seem much harm given general robustness design element increases robustness positions verse highly correlated linguistic feature speciﬁcally compute relative position pivot occurs verse apply gaussian ﬁlter i.e. center bell curve around total score position ﬁlter values

subsequence english correct past. averaged n-gram sizes chinese consistent tense marking future results poor. russian polish perform poorly central grammatical category aspect tense. poor performance arabic limits character n-gram features templatic language. evaluation noticed surprising amount variation within translations language; e.g. top-ranked n-grams german translations include names like paulus. suspect literal translations linear alignment yields good n-grams. many translations free e.g. change sequence clauses. deteriorates mined n-grams. hierarchical clusterings markers.
