{"title": "Deep neural heart rate variability analysis", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "I.2"], "abstract": "Despite of the pain and limited accuracy of blood tests for early recognition of cardiovascular disease, they dominate risk screening and triage. On the other hand, heart rate variability is non-invasive and cheap, but not considered accurate enough for clinical practice. Here, we tackle heart beat interval based classification with deep learning. We introduce an end to end differentiable hybrid architecture, consisting of a layer of biological neuron models of cardiac dynamics (modified FitzHugh Nagumo neurons) and several layers of a standard feed-forward neural network. The proposed model is evaluated on ECGs from 474 stable at-risk (coronary artery disease) patients, and 1172 chest pain patients of an emergency department. We show that it can significantly outperform models based on traditional heart rate variability predictors, as well as approaching or in some cases outperforming clinical blood tests, based only on 60 seconds of inter-beat intervals.", "text": "despite pain limited accuracy blood tests early recognition cardiovascular disease dominate risk screening triage. hand heart rate variability non-invasive cheap considered accurate enough clinical practice. here tackle heart beat interval based classiﬁcation deep learning. introduce differentiable hybrid architecture consisting layer biological neuron models cardiac dynamics several layers standard feedforward neural network. proposed model evaluated ecgs stable at-risk patients chest pain patients emergency department. show signiﬁcantly outperform models based traditional heart rate variability predictors well approaching cases outperforming clinical blood tests based seconds interbeat intervals. mammalian heart beats induced control mechanism generates electrical impulses precipitate muscular contraction. impulses generated sinoatrial node often called heart’s natural pacemaker propagated atrioventricular node hispurkinje system normally synchronized activity san. large body previous work investigated oscillator-based models heart beat dynamics since proposal oscillator recent modiﬁed fitzhugh-nagumo model cardiac dynamics heart beat dynamics academic interest time series heart beat intervals shown prognostic several types cardiovascular disease thus could basis risk markers easy measure non-invasively. various families disease predictors proposed heart rate variability analysis literature including statistical measures standard deviation intervals fractal dynamical systems properties entropy measures symbolic dynamics recently graph-based measures models used artiﬁcial neural networks combine classify predictors however large superﬁcial predictors above-mentioned oscillator models exhibiting biologically plausible dynamics;
