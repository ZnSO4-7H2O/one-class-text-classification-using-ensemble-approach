{"title": "Image Segmentation to Distinguish Between Overlapping Human Chromosomes", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "q-bio.QM", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In medicine, visualizing chromosomes is important for medical diagnostics, drug development, and biomedical research. Unfortunately, chromosomes often overlap and it is necessary to identify and distinguish between the overlapping chromosomes. A segmentation solution that is fast and automated will enable scaling of cost effective medicine and biomedical research. We apply neural network-based image segmentation to the problem of distinguishing between partially overlapping DNA chromosomes. A convolutional neural network is customized for this problem. The results achieved intersection over union (IOU) scores of 94.7% for the overlapping region and 88-94% on the non-overlapping chromosome regions.", "text": "medicine visualizing chromosomes
