{"title": "Artificial Neural Networks for Beginners", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "C.1.3; I.5.1"], "abstract": "The scope of this teaching package is to make a brief induction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for people who have no previous knowledge of them. We first make a brief introduction to models of networks, for then describing in general terms ANNs. As an application, we explain the backpropagation algorithm, since it is widely used and many other algorithms are derived from it. The user should know algebra and the handling of functions and vectors. Differential calculus is recommendable, but not necessary. The contents of this package should be understood by people with high school education. It would be useful for people who are just curious about what are ANNs, or for people who want to become familiar with them, so when they study them more fully, they will already have clear notions of ANNs. Also, people who only want to apply the backpropagation algorithm without a detailed and formal explanation of it will find this material useful. This work should not be seen as \"Nets for dummies\", but of course it is not a treatise. Much of the formality is skipped for the sake of simplicity. Detailed explanations and demonstrations can be found in the referred readings. The included exercises complement the understanding of the theory. The on-line resources are highly recommended for extending this brief induction.", "text": "scope teaching package make brief induction artificial neural networks people previous knowledge them. first make brief introduction models networks describing general terms anns. application explain backpropagation algorithm since widely used many algorithms derived user know algebra handling functions vectors. differential calculus recommendable necessary. contents package understood people high school education. would useful people curious anns people want become familiar them study fully already clear notions anns. also people want apply backpropagation algorithm without detailed formal explanation find material useful. work seen nets dummies course treatise. much formality skipped sake simplicity. detailed explanations demonstrations found referred readings. included exercises complement understanding theory. on-line resources highly recommended extending brief induction. efficient solving complex problems following lemma divide conquer. complex system decomposed simpler elements order able understand also simple elements gathered produce complex system networks approach achieving this. large number different types networks characterized following components nodes connections nodes. interactions nodes though connections lead global behaviour network cannot observed elements network. global behaviour said emergent. means abilities network supercede ones elements making networks powerful tool. networks used model wide range phenomena physics computer science biochemistry ethology mathematics sociology economics telecommunications many areas. many systems seen network proteins computers communities etc. systems could network?
