{"title": "Determining the best attributes for surveillance video keywords  generation", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Automatic video keyword generation is one of the key ingredients in reducing the burden of security officers in analyzing surveillance videos. Keywords or attributes are generally chosen manually based on expert knowledge of surveillance. Most existing works primarily aim at either supervised learning approaches relying on extensive manual labelling or hierarchical probabilistic models that assume the features are extracted using the bag-of-words approach; thus limiting the utilization of the other features. To address this, we turn our attention to automatic attribute discovery approaches. However, it is not clear which automatic discovery approach can discover the most meaningful attributes. Furthermore, little research has been done on how to compare and choose the best automatic attribute discovery methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the shared structure exhibited amongst meaningful attributes, that enables us to compare between different automatic attribute discovery approaches.We then validate our approach by comparing various attribute discovery methods such as PiCoDeS on two attribute datasets. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to select the automatic discovery approach that discovers the most meaningful attributes. We then employ the best discovery approach to generate keywords for videos recorded from a surveillance system. This work shows it is possible to massively reduce the amount of manual work in generating video keywords without limiting ourselves to a particular video feature descriptor.", "text": "automatic
