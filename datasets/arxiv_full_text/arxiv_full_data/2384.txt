Most of the methods presented in literature focused on tree-structured taxonomies, but only few on taxonomies structured according to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In this contribution novel classification ensemble algorithms for DAG-structured taxonomies are introduced. In particular Hierarchical Top-Down (HTD-DAG) and True Path Rule (TPR-DAG) for DAGs are presented and discussed.", "text": "several real problems ranging text classiﬁcation computational biology characterized hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation tasks. methods presented literature focused tree-structured taxonomies taxonomies structured according directed acyclic graph contribution novel classiﬁcation ensemble algorithms dag-structured taxonomies introduced. particular hierarchical top-down true path rule dags presented discussed. hierarchical classiﬁcation problems characterized taxonomies structured according pre-deﬁned hierarchy. examples context gene protein function prediction include trees directed acyclic graphs functional classes connected according tree extensive experimental studies showed prediction i.e. predictions class made independently classes introduce signiﬁcant inconsistencies classiﬁcation violation true path rule governs hierarchical relationships classes according rule positive predictions given term must transferred ancestor terms negative predictions descendants. ﬁrst step base learner separately interacting connected base learners learns protein functional category per-term basis. cases yields independent classiﬁcation problems base learning machine trained learn speciﬁc functional term independently base learners. second step predictions provided trained classiﬁers combined considering hierarchical relationships base classiﬁers modeled according hierarchy functional classes. hierarchical classiﬁcation particular ensemble methods hierarchical classiﬁcation applied several domains ranging protein function prediction text categorization music genre classiﬁcation hierarchical image classiﬁcation video annotation automatic classiﬁcation world wide documents general review hierarchical classiﬁcation methods applications diﬀerent domains provided review hierarchical ensemble methods context computational biology provided proposed ensemble methods proposed tree-structured taxonomies dag-structured taxonomies contribution propose discuss novel hierarchical ensemble methods dags particular hierarchical top-down true path rule algorithms variants speciﬁcally designed dag-structured taxonomies. directed acyclic graph vertices edges represents taxonomy structured whose nodes represent classes taxonomy directed edge hierarchical relationships parent class child class. assume exist unique root node root dag;
