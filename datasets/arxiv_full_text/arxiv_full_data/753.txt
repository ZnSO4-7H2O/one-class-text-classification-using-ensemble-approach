Work has been done towards improving the efficiency of such systems by using intelligent algorithms to generate search queries, however, not much research has been done in the direction of incorporating human-and-society level knowledge in the queries. This paper is one of the first attempts where such information is incorporated into the search queries using Wikipedia semantics. The paper presents an essential shift from conventional token based queries to concept based queries, leading to an enhanced efficiency of information retrieval systems. To efficiently handle the automated query learning problem, we propose Wikipedia-based Evolutionary Semantics (Wiki-ES) framework where concept based queries are learnt using a co-evolving evolutionary procedure. Learning concept based queries using an intelligent evolutionary procedure yields significant improvement in performance which is shown through an extensive study using Reuters newswire documents. Comparison of the proposed framework is performed with other information retrieval systems. Concept based approach has also been implemented on other information retrieval systems to justify the effectiveness of a transition from token based queries to concept based queries.", "text":

deﬁnition denote collection wikipedia-articles available language wikipedia-concept deﬁned article uniquely identiﬁed representative certain concept. deﬁnition least questions follow. ﬁrst concerned concept-recognition. clearly uncommon several concepts share textual representation. thus able resolve whether certain concept present document non-trivial problem. literature commonly referred wikiﬁcation task automatic topic-linking problem discussed closely outlining content model used wiki-es; section second question discussed following section concerns semantic relatedness -pair -pair measured. needs resolved discuss idea behind wikipedia-based query rules learned example documents provided user. particular need notion semantic relatedness evaluating whether document matches given

strube ponzetto proposed wikirelate-technique modiﬁed existing measures better work wikipedia. soon followed paper gabrilovich markovitch suggested explicit semantic analysis deﬁne highly accurate

computationally cheap still achieved relatively high correlation humans adopted basis similarity measures used paper. relatedness measure essentially corresponds normalized google distance inspired

nevertheless well-established articles considered speed essential kind graph-based approach proven reasonably reliable measuring proximity arbitrary pair concepts. considered computation semantic

given concept here maximum rather sum-based operator average deliberate choice. since d-rel intended used evaluating whether document matches given query want allow sum-operations mask presence concepts document related central theme. illustrate idea consider single-concept query documents industrial espionage. suppose receive large document manufacturing discussion concerned general economics models. however document still single paragraph stolen trade secrets car-prototype speciﬁcations. order prevent document’s main theme hiding relatedness industrial spying choose measure relatedness using concept best associated espionage. particular case trade secret strongly linked industrial espionage natural association evaluate overall relatedness document given query. demand automated query learning driven diﬃculty formulating eﬀective queries match user’s information needs. finding appropriate search terms conditions generally hard even expert users. therefore given certain topic task query learning systems help user query deﬁnition improved precision recall. size world’s information base growing staggering rate problem becoming increasingly pressing. alleviate large number competing solutions query formulation proposed commonality approaches reliance form relevance feedback system elicits feedback statements user. ﬁrst model categories relevance feedback used modifying user’s previous query removing adding terms adjusting weights better reﬂect user’s relevance judgements. example many probabilistic models documentvector modiﬁcation models belong categories; e.g. salton buckley rocchio yang korfhage horng boughanem focus third category query-structure learning takes learning process step context boolean fuzzy boolean queries. attempts infer terms appropriate representing given query also tries learn query’s structure i.e. determines boolean operators used join diﬀerent concepts. many texts query learning considered reserved word representing third type query deﬁnition functional form concepts query free variables; e.g. c´ordon l´opez-herrera references. iqbe paradigm wiki-es system introduced paper mainly viewed structural query learning models. therefore rest paper following general deﬁnition refer query learning problem. deﬁnition admissible concepts denote space admissible queries formed using concepts query learning task boolean expression best represents user’s information needs applying following syntactic rules many ways approach problem without semantic knowledge. stage notice deﬁnition remains deliberately abstract specifying concepts understood learnt queries matched documents. course classical boolean queries using bag-of-words approach considered answer quite straightforward. however atoms query uniquely deﬁned concepts longer self-evident query evaluated. fact wiki-es model performance diﬀerences concept-based word-based approaches follow concept-relationship information used matching documents learnt queries. best known bag-of-words based methods solving query learning problem inductive query example framework originated smith smith chen idea behind iqbe paradigm principle similar relevance feedback; require explicit relevance statements user guide retrieval process. iqbe user provides system collection sample documents algorithm learns terms boolean operators joining them obtained query best represent user’s information need. however instead modifying existing query iteratively system performs single generate fresh query scratch. learnt query available executed boolean information retrieval system portability queries considered characteristics distinguishes iqbe systems general relevance feedback. descriptions iqbe architecture commonly emphasized presenting iqbe system separate unit outside irs; l´opez-herrera figure descriptions general iqbe system. iqbe framework query learning task viewed large optimization problem search space consists possible queries presented irs. therefore recognizing high dimensionality problem surprise iqbe approaches usually rely form evolutionary computation. particular following early studies kraft smith smith genetic programming gained ground robust choice query learning. recently number frameworks based multiobjective genetic programming also examined. fact performance mostly evaluated terms precision recall appears natural consider query learning inherently multiobjective problem. interesting applications multiobjective evolutionary algorithms e.g. c´ordon l´opez-herrera discussed tamine popularity evolutionary algorithms largely explained implicit parallelism allows search diﬀerent regions solution space simultaneously. also argued evolutionary algorithms less sensitive quality initial query. whereas classical relevance feedback methods rocchio perform poorly initial query fails retrieve relevant documents. probabilistic exploration induced evolutionary algorithms permits search unexplored areas independent initial query hence evolutionary algorithms well-justiﬁed choice query learning non-expert users rarely good query ﬁrst complicated topics considered. although automated query learning problem stimulated interest past years noteworthy majority development concentrated improving learning algorithms rather examining role query document representations. however recognizing fact semantic information transformed many natural language processing applications consider worthwhile section present wiki-es framework automated query learning. approach based genetic programming paradigm potent tool artiﬁcial intelligence performing program induction. idea principles evolutionary computation intelligently search space possible computer programs ﬁnding individual highly solving problem hand. eﬀect could purpose machine generate solution problem without explicitly programmed example case want wiki-es system learn program leads recovery high number relevant documents keeping irrelevant documents aloof. learning process driven evolutionary pressure guarantees ﬁttest individuals among potential query candidates survive. bird-eye’s view wiki-es framework resembles architecture iqbe paradigm idea system able learn optimal query using small sample documents represent user’s current topic information need. surface sounds simple. however examining steps involved learning process becomes clear number choices ranging choice query document models choice genetic procedure large impacts outcome. illustrate wiki-es approaches query learning problem consider example user seeks deﬁne query picks documents economic espionage ignores ones politics military espionage. then split wiki-es process following steps training data generation suppose user already found bunch documents considers highly relevant topic also collection documents concerned espionage military spying industrial espionage. then learning intelligent query i.e. wiki-es rule learning step training

detailed description rules given section gp-algorithm described section feeding wiki-es rule documents wiki-based information retrieval system optimal wiki-es rule known given matching subsystem

framework hence responsibility rule-evaluator utilise wikipedia’s concept-relatedness information determining whether query concepts present active document either directly indirectly. ruleevaluator

remainder section organized follows. first section discuss wikipedia-based content model used within document modeling subsystem wirs. then section continues outlining structure rule-matching

however model employed extends wikiﬁcation-process splitting found concepts categories general wikipedia-concepts named-entity concepts using named-entity recognizer. explain rationale modiﬁcation consider example named entity goldman sachs general concept investment banking. certain document discusses goldman sachs requires bank’s name explicitly mentioned. hand document investment banking suﬃcient collection investment banking related concepts rather exact concept name identify document relevant. clearly diﬀerent nature general concepts named-entities taken account specifying sensitivity wiki-es model diﬀerent concept types. hence wiki-es document interpreted pair collections named-entities wikipedia concepts. example document contains wikipedia-concepts investment banking goldman sachs morgan stanley mortgage credit simply present document model split parts {goldman sachs morgan stanley} {investment banking mortgage credit}. document model implemented stages wikiﬁcation named-entity recognition. usual preprocessing steps carried ﬁrst stage identify wikipedia-concepts present document. stage separation named-entities general concepts made. here

approach mentioned section wiki-es rule viewed composition number queries. wiki-es rule underlying structure essentially diﬀerent seen ordinary boolean queries. provide accurate picture formalise deﬁnition wiki-es rule voting system several concept based queries voting weighted votes taken represent relevance document. presentation wiki-es model structured follows. first deﬁne wiki-queries

admissible wiki-queries convert query learning task problem ﬁnding optimal wiki-es rule maximizes f-score respect given collection training documents. rationale deﬁning learning problem terms wiki-es
