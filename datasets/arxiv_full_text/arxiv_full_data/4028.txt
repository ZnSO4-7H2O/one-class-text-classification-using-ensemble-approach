{"title": "Evidential Reasoning in Image Understanding", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present some results of evidential reasoning in understanding multispectral images of remote sensing systems. The Dempster-Shafer approach of combination of evidences is pursued to yield contextual classification results, which are compared with previous results of the Bayesian context free classification, contextual classifications of dynamic programming and stochastic relaxation approaches.", "text": "paper present results evidential reasoning understanding images remote sensing systems. dempster-shafer contextual classification bayesian context free classification dynamic programming stochastic relaxation significant symbolic linguistic information processing. however evidential reasoning spatial information interest recently. spatial information processing important medical automation applications. addition usual uncertainty uncertainty arises spatial information requires paper shall study uncertainty image understanding multispectral alternate approaches bayesian context free classification contextual classification contextual classification contextual classification turns percentage multispectral increasing order. types context information real world images. local pixel-based context information; context information. developed using local context information small neighborhoods unsolved deal \"mixed pixels\" effectively. solve problem meet increasing demand classification accuracy research focus multispectral scanner system provides spectral quantitative size shape texture lowest level image data. classification analyse quantitative uncertain illustration single parameter terrain single feature correlated interest. multispectral vegetation encompasses integration probabilistic capture full information region size. region shapes. region shape characterized -fit elong direc the. region. region computed. ratio area region area enclosing rectangle rotations investigated eight classes wheat alfalfa rangeland selected testing. thomas contextual dynamic programming contextual first band scene cropfield clarke oregon. bayes preclassification result contextual classification result stochastic relaxation contextual classificaÂ­ tion using dempster-shafer approach.", "year": 2013}
