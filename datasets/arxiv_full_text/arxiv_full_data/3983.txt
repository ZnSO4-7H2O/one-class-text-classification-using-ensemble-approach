{"title": "Oil Price Trackers Inspired by Immune Memory", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "We outline initial concepts for an immune inspired algorithm to evaluate and predict oil price time series data. The proposed solution evolves a short term pool of trackers dynamically, with each member attempting to map trends and anticipate future price movements. Successful trackers feed into a long term memory pool that can generalise across repeating trend patterns. The resulting sequence of trackers, ordered in time, can be used as a forecasting tool. Examination of the pool of evolving trackers also provides valuable insight into the properties of the crude oil market.", "text": "outline initial concepts immune inspired algorithm evaluate predict
