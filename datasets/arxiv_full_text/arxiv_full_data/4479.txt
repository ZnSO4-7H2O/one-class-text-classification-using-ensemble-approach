{"title": "The Prioritized Inductive Logic Programs", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "I.2.3; I.2.6"], "abstract": "The limit behavior of inductive logic programs has not been explored, but when considering incremental or online inductive learning algorithms which usually run ongoingly, such behavior of the programs should be taken into account. An example is given to show that some inductive learning algorithm may not be correct in the long run if the limit behavior is not considered. An inductive logic program is convergent if given an increasing sequence of example sets, the program produces a corresponding sequence of the Horn logic programs which has the set-theoretic limit, and is limit-correct if the limit of the produced sequence of the Horn logic programs is correct with respect to the limit of the sequence of the example sets. It is shown that the GOLEM system is not limit-correct. Finally, a limit-correct inductive logic system, called the prioritized GOLEM system, is proposed as a solution.", "text": "inductive logic. precisely given sequence {πn} ﬁrst order theories settheoretic limit {πn} denoted sentences every sentence almost every every sentence inﬁnitely many πn’s also. set-theoretic limit always exist sequence ﬁrst order theories. examples come sequences example time inductive learning algorithm produces theory every correct respect later shall give example show inductive learning algorithms", "year": 2002}
