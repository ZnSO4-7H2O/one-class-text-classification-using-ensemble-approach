In the case when for a computable probability distribution $P_\\theta$ an effectively strongly consistent estimate exists, we show that the Levin's a priory semicomputable semimeasure of the set of all $P_\\theta$-random sequences is positive if and only if the parameter $\\theta$ is a computable real number. The different methods for generating ``meaningful'' $P_\\theta$-random sequences with noncomputable $\\theta$ are discussed.", "text": "study priori semimeasure sets pθ-random inﬁnite sequences family probability distributions depending real parameter case computable probability distribution eﬀectively strictly consistent estimator exists show levin’s priory semimeasure pθ-random sequences positive parameter computable real number. bernoulli family show priory semimeasure bθ-random sequences union taken non-random positive. parametric family probability distributions real number given eﬀectively strictly consistent estimator exists family. bernoulli family real parameter example family. theorem shows levin’s priory semimeasure pθ-random sequences positive parameter value computable real number. property inﬁnite sequences empirical meaning levin’s priory semimeasure sequences possessing property respect model biased coin prespeciﬁed probability head meaningless noncomputable real number;
