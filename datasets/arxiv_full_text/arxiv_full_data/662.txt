{"title": "Evaluation of Alzheimer's Disease by Analysis of MR Images using  Multilayer Perceptrons and Kohonen SOM Classifiers as an Alternative to the  ADC Maps", "tag": ["eess.IV", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, yet hard to diagnose precisely without invasive techniques, particularly at the onset of the disease. This work approaches image analysis and classification of synthetic multispectral images composed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) cerebral images for the evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid area and measuring the advance of Alzheimer's disease. A clinical 1.5 T MR imaging system was used to acquire all images presented. The classification methods are based on multilayer perceptrons and Kohonen Self-Organized Map classifiers. We assume the classes of interest can be separated by hyperquadrics. Therefore, a 2-degree polynomial network is used to classify the original image, generating the ground truth image. The classification results are used to improve the usual analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient map.", "text": "usually evaluation progress alzheimer’s disease using image analysis dw-mr images performed acquisition least three images slice interest acquired using sequence spin-echo stejskaltanner different diffusion exponents exponents s/mm t-weighted spin-echo image then fourth image calculated apparent diffusion coefﬁcient pixel associated corresponding apparent diffusion coefﬁcient associated voxel brighter pixels greater corresponding apparent diffusion coefﬁcients work proposes approach evaluate progress alzheimer’s disease usually presents pixels considerable intensities regions occupied head patient degree uncertainty also considered pixels inside sample. furthermore sensitive noisy images therefore case study images used compose multispectral image diffusion-weighted image considered spectral band synthetic multispectral image. dw-mr images acquired clinical images database laboratory images department physics universidade federal pernambuco recife brazil. database composed real clinical images acquired clinical imaging system. order compare methods used cerebral dwmr images corresponding -year-old male patient alzheimer’s disease. perform training proposed analysis chose images corresponding slice showing temporal corni lateral ventriculi furnish better evaluation specialist facilitate correlation data generated computational tool priori knowledge specialist. diffusion-weighted images grid image codomain. synthetic multispectral image composed images ﬁgures given abstract— alzheimer’s disease common cause dementia hard diagnose precisely without invasive techniques particularly disease. work approaches image analysis classiﬁcation synthetic multispectral images composed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance cerebral images evaluation cerebrospinal ﬂuid area measuring advance alzheimer’s disease. clinical imaging system used acquire images presented. classiﬁcation methods based multilayer perceptrons kohonen self-organized classiﬁers. assume classes interest separated hyperquadrics. therefore -degree polynomial network used classify original image generating ground truth image. classiﬁcation results used improve usual analysis apparent diffusion coefﬁcient map. alzheimer’s disease common cause dementia senile presenile individuals observing gradual progress disease individual becomes older major manifestation alzheimer’s disease falling cognitive functions gradual loss memory including psychological neurological behavioral symptoms indicating declining diary life activities whole. alzheimer’s disease characterized reduction gray matter growth cerebral sulci. however white matter also affected although relation alzheimer’s disease white matter still unknown acquisition diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images turns possible visualization dilation lateral ventriculi temporal corni enhancing augment sulci related advance alzheimer’s disease therefore volumetrical measuring cerebral structures important diagnosis evaluation progress diseases like alzheimer’s especially measuring volumes occupied sulci lateral ventriculi turning possible addition quantitative work supported part cnpq brazil. wellington santos department electronics systems universidade federal pernambuco department computing systems universidade pernambuco recife pernambuco brazil gyromagnetic ratio gradient applied experiment figures show images diffusion exponents s/mm s/mm s/mm respectively. analysis dw-mr images often performed using resulting fadc calculated follows therefore pixels proportional diffusion coefﬁcients corresponding voxels. ﬁgure several artifacts associated presence noise. regions image signal-to-noise ratio poor produces artifacts consequence calculation logarithm therefore pixels necessarily correspond diffusion coefﬁcients apparent diffusion coefﬁcients several pixels indicate high diffusion rates voxels sample present solid areas like e.g. bone cranial seen ﬁgure fact leave degree uncertainty values inside brain area. work propose alternative analysis multispectral analysis image using methods based neural networks alternative could easily extended diffusionweighted images cerebral ones. nuclear spin diffusion coefﬁcient measured i-th experiment associated voxel mapped pixel position nuclear spin density voxel;
