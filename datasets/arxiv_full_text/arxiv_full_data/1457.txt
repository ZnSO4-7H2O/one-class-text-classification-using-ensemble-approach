{"title": "Understanding State Preferences With Text As Data: Introducing the UN  General Debate Corpus", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Every year at the United Nations, member states deliver statements during the General Debate discussing major issues in world politics. These speeches provide invaluable information on governments' perspectives and preferences on a wide range of issues, but have largely been overlooked in the study of international politics. This paper introduces a new dataset consisting of over 7,701 English-language country statements from 1970-2016. We demonstrate how the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) can be used to derive country positions on different policy dimensions using text analytic methods. The paper provides applications of these estimates, demonstrating the contribution the UNGDC can make to the study of international politics.", "text": "∗authors’ names listed alphabetical order. authors contributed equally work. acknowledge receipt dublin city university enhancing performance award. would like thank soﬁa collignon delmar elvin gjevori karl murphy mohsen moheimany bethsabee souris excellent research assistance. also grateful kristin bakke alex braithwaite david hudson hicks jeff kucik lucas leemann neil mitchell erik voeten helpful comments advice. general debate corpus made available harvard dataverse http//dx.doi.org/./dvn/tjxy. table general debate corpus. note descriptive statistics ungdc containing statements delivered heads state representative president european commission made separate statement behalf figure wordscore note scores estimated quanteda package follow standard preprocessing tokenization stage remove english stopwords perform stemming. also trim document-feature matrix features appear least times three documents. given reference score russia results rescaled using classical rescale hence predicted scores beyond range. ontheﬁrstandseconddimensionsasdiscussedintext.overlaidlinesareloesssmoothers. figurecaandcaofalliesandopponents.notethefoursubplotsshowcorrespondenceanalysisestimatesforusarussiaandtheuk figure choosing optimal number dimensions estimated model results. note upper subplot displays results leave-one-out-cross-validation analysis choose optimal number dimensions estimated model discussed text. bottom subplot displays coefﬁcients estimated model discussed text cis. coefﬁcients statistically signiﬁcant speciﬁcation fewer observations original analysis kelley includes nonun members states participate year i.e. absent text data. section iraq inquiry http//www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/ /the-report-of-the-iraq-inquiry_section-.pdf accessed january make ungdc publicly available harvard dataverse http//dx.doi. org/./dvn/tjxy. also developed browsing tool allows users explore individual documents topics covered including words characterize topics evolution topics time word distributions across topics underlying digitized texts speeches source pdfs http//ungd.smikhaylov.net. website also enables users download general debate corpus. detailed information available sessions transcripts earlier sessions provide degree detail regarding post speaker. rare cases post speaker missing transcript sessions added information. implement simplest speciﬁcation search using additive models. users imple-", "year": 2017}
