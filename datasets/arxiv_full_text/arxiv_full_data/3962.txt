{"title": "Cognitive Architecture for Direction of Attention Founded on Subliminal  Memory Searches, Pseudorandom and Nonstop", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE", "I.2.0; C.1.3"], "abstract": "By way of explaining how a brain works logically, human associative memory is modeled with logical and memory neurons, corresponding to standard digital circuits. The resulting cognitive architecture incorporates basic psychological elements such as short term and long term memory. Novel to the architecture are memory searches using cues chosen pseudorandomly from short term memory. Recalls alternated with sensory images, many tens per second, are analyzed subliminally as an ongoing process, to determine a direction of attention in short term memory.", "text": "term architecture implies model input-output behavior physical structure. physical structure refers size weight also known electrical logical properties. neuroscience aside central goal cognitive architecture build practical thinking machine intelligent agent ‘reasons’ like human towards desired implement cognition general detection particular signal outside world. preferably cognition must occur timely self-contained humans. architecture must address information readily available psychology texts including short term memory. valid architecture must memory capable holding brief time encoded signals senses emotional signals signals created recall long term memory. cognitive architecture models physical structure subconscious long term memory must associative;
