{"title": "Computational complexity and simulation of rare events of Ising spin  glasses", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "G.1.6; I.2.8; I.2.6; J.2"], "abstract": "We discuss the computational complexity of random 2D Ising spin glasses, which represent an interesting class of constraint satisfaction problems for black box optimization. Two extremal cases are considered: (1) the +/- J spin glass, and (2) the Gaussian spin glass. We also study a smooth transition between these two extremal cases. The computational complexity of all studied spin glass systems is found to be dominated by rare events of extremely hard spin glass samples. We show that complexity of all studied spin glass systems is closely related to Frechet extremal value distribution. In a hybrid algorithm that combines the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) with a deterministic bit-flip hill climber, the number of steps performed by both the global searcher (hBOA) and the local searcher follow Frechet distributions. Nonetheless, unlike in methods based purely on local search, the parameters of these distributions confirm good scalability of hBOA with local search. We further argue that standard performance measures for optimization algorithms--such as the average number of evaluations until convergence--can be misleading. Finally, our results indicate that for highly multimodal constraint satisfaction problems, such as Ising spin glasses, recombination-based search can provide qualitatively better results than mutation-based search.", "text": "abstract. discuss computational complexity random ising spin glasses represent interesting class constraint satisfaction problems black optimization. extremal cases considered spin glass gaussian spin glass. also study smooth transition extremal cases. computational complexity studied spin glass systems found dominated rare events extremely hard spin glass samples. show complexity studied spin glass systems closely related fr´echet extremal value distribution. hybrid algorithm combines hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm deterministic bit-ﬂip hill climber number steps performed global searcher local searcher follow fr´echet distributions. nonetheless unlike methods based purely local search parameters distributions conﬁrm good scalability hboa local search. argue standard performance measures optimization algorithms—such average number evaluations convergence—can misleading. finally results indicate highly multimodal constraint satisfaction problems ising spin glasses recombination-based search provide qualitatively better results mutation-based search. spin glass problem old-standing still intensively studied problem physics first experimental realizations spin glass systems exist properties particular dynamics still well explained. second spin glasses pose challenging unsolved problem theoretical physics since nature spin glass state temperatures understood. statistical physics usual goal calculate desired quantity distribution conﬁgurations spin glass system given temperature. probability observing speciﬁc spin conﬁguration spin glass governed boltzmann distribution inversely proportional exponential ratio energy temperapossible conﬁgurations spin glass concentrates near conﬁgurations minimum energy also called ground states. ground-state properties capture temperatures physics therefore interesting study them. another perspective spin glasses represent interesting class problems black-box optimization task ground states given spin glass sample energy landscape spin glasses exhibits features make challenging optimization benchmark. features large number local optima often grows exponentially number decision variables problem. large number local optima using local search operators mutation almost always intractable. paper present analyze discuss series experiments ising spin glasses. random spin glass instances ﬁxed lattice geometry generated randomly sampling ﬁxed distribution coupling constants. distinguish basic classes random ising spin glass systems coupling constants initialized randomly either bution. transition cases also considered. apply hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm local search considered classes spin glasses provide thorough statistical analysis hboa performance large number problem instances class. results discussed context state-of-the-art monte carlo methods wang-landau algorithm multicanonical method finally identify important lessons work genetic evolutionary computation. following present short review hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm extremal value distributions used statistical analysis. section deﬁne ising spin glass systems analyzed work introduce several classes random spin glass instances. section presents experimental methodology results. finally section summarizes concludes paper. hierarchical bayesian optimization algorithm advanced genetic evolutionary algorithms based primarily selection recombination. hboa evolves population candidate solutions given problem. using population solutions opposed single solution several advantages;
