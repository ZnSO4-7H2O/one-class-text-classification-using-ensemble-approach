The proposed approach employs a matrix IR-imager to remotely register the space-time distribution of surface temperature pattern, which is determined by the dynamics of local cerebral blood flow. The advantages of this technique are non-invasiveness, zero risks for the health of patients and medical staff, low implementation and operational costs, ease and speed of use. Traditional IR-diagnostic technique has a crucial limitation - it involves a diagnostician who determines the boundaries of tumor areas, which gives rise to considerable uncertainty, which can lead to diagnosis errors that are difficult to control. The current study demonstrates that implementing deep learning algorithms allows to eliminate the explained drawback.", "text": "abstract. eﬃciency deep machine learning automatic delineation tumor areas demonstrated intraoperative neuronavigation using active irmapping cold test. proposed approach employs matrix ir-imager remotely register space-time distribution surface temperature pattern determined dynamics local cerebral blood ﬂow. advantages technique non-invasiveness zero risks health patients medical staﬀ implementation operational costs ease speed use. traditional ir-diagnostic technique crucial limitation involves diagnostician determines boundaries tumor areas gives rise considerable uncertainty lead diagnosis errors diﬃcult control. current study demonstrates implementing deep learning algorithms allows eliminate explained drawback. today brain tumor removal neurosurgery clinics diﬀerent techniques intraoperative neuronavigation tractography ﬂuorescence diagnostics laser biospectroscopy etc. technologies yield clinical data various resolution quite expensive diﬃcult limitations. ir-imager remotely register space-time distribution surface temperature pattern directly correlated dynamics local cerebral blood ﬂow. established brain tumor invasion areas topography blood vessels changed autoregulation cerebral blood disrupted. demonstrated isostatic distribution cortex temperature informative delineation pathology area. approach using irthermal mapping diagnosis often yields negative research results whereas cold test disrupts compensatory autoregulation mechanisms temporarily reversibly allows make successful functional topical diagnosis rule technique involves visual assessment ir-thermal maps trained specialist determines presence pathology area probable boundaries. human factor gives rise considerable uncertainty lead diagnosis errors diﬃcult control. research demonstrates implementing algorithms deep learning removes limitation automating detection pathology areas delineation tumor projection cortex surface. accuracy approach potentially developed degree eﬀectively used intraoperative planning transcortical interventions tumor removal surgeons. central feature active ir-thermal mapping exposed area dura mater brain cortex removal intracranial tumors application cold probe i.e. uniform irrigation dura mater brain cortex trephine opening nacl solution test perturbs thermal regulation system brain cause perceptible variation dynamics temperature pattern recovery within tumor projection cortex surface outside craniotomy register initial thermal dura mater opening dura mater thermal exposed cortex. cold probe applied stages. cyclogram ir-monitoring relation major procedures shown fig. figure ir-monitoring cyclogram tifr thermal recording;
