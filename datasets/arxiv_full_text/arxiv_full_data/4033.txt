The main sources of error are more or less straightforward to identify: camera resolution, structure of the observed terrain and DTM accuracy, field of view and camera trajectory. After characterizing and modeling these error sources in the framework of the CDTM algorithm, a closed form expression for their effect on the pose and motion errors of the camera can be found. The analytic expression provides a priori measurements for the accuracy in terms of the parameters mentioned above.", "text": "structure observed terrain accuracy. algorithm terrain navigation
