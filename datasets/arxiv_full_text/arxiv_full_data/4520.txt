We show that for the class of all computationally efficient outcome-forecast-based checking rules, this property is violated. Moreover, we present a probabilistic algorithm generating with probability close to one a sequence with a subsequence which simultaneously miscalibrates all partially weakly computable randomized forecasting algorithms. %subsequences non-learnable by each randomized algorithm.
