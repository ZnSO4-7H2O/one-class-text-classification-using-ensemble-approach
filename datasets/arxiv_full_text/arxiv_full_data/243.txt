{"title": "Convolutional Neural Network for Stereotypical Motor Movement Detection  in Autism", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are often associated with specific atypical postural or motor behaviors, of which Stereotypical Motor Movements (SMMs) have a specific visibility. While the identification and the quantification of SMM patterns remain complex, its automation would provide support to accurate tuning of the intervention in the therapy of autism. Therefore, it is essential to develop automatic SMM detection systems in a real world setting, taking care of strong inter-subject and intra-subject variability. Wireless accelerometer sensing technology can provide a valid infrastructure for real-time SMM detection, however such variability remains a problem also for machine learning methods, in particular whenever handcrafted features extracted from accelerometer signal are considered. Here, we propose to employ the deep learning paradigm in order to learn discriminating features from multi-sensor accelerometer signals. Our results provide preliminary evidence that feature learning and transfer learning embedded in the deep architecture achieve higher accurate SMM detectors in longitudinal scenarios.", "text": "abstract. autism spectrum disorders associated speciﬁc atypical postural motor behaviors stereotypical motor movements severely interfere learning social interactions. wireless inertial sensing technology oﬀers valid infrastructure automatic real-time detection would provide support tuned intervention possibly early alert onset meltevents. however identiﬁcation quantiﬁcation patterns remains complex strong inter-subject intra-subject variability hard deal handcrafted features. propose employ deep learning paradigm order learn discriminative features directly multi-sensor accelerometer signals. results convolutional neural networks provide preliminary evidence feature learning transfer learning embedded deep architectures lead accurate robust detectors longitudinal scenarios. autism spectrum disorders deﬁned range developmental disability conditions eﬀect degree social interaction communication abilities patients. prevalence reported individuals generally characterized restricted repetitive stereotyped patterns behavior patients. stereotypical motor movements autism signiﬁcantly restrict learning social interactions. further smms frequently increase occasion emotional sensory overload lead autistic meltdown events. alleviating smms thus primary target interventions requires accurate tools recognizing quantifying patterns. order guide behavioral interventions possibly prevent insurgence worthwhile consider limitations traditional methods measuring e.g. paper-and-pencil rating scales direct behavioral observation video-based coding. measures wireless accelerometer sensing technology machine learning techniques provide automatic time eﬃcient accurate measure many signal processing applications detection commonly based extracting ad-hoc features accelerometer signals. wide variety feature extraction methods used literature. generally types features extracted accelerometer signal time domain features;
