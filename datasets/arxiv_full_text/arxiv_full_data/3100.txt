{"title": "Learning Graphical Models of Images, Videos and Their Spatial  Transformations", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Mixtures of Gaussians, factor analyzers (probabilistic PCA) and hidden Markov models are staples of static and dynamic data modeling and image and video modeling in particular. We show how topographic transformations in the input, such as translation and shearing in images, can be accounted for in these models by including a discrete transformation variable. The resulting models perform clustering, dimensionality reduction and time-series analysis in a way that is invariant to transformations in the input. Using the EM algorithm, these transformation-invariant models can be fit to static data and time series. We give results on filtering microscopy images, face and facial pose clustering, handwritten digit modeling and recognition, video clustering, object tracking, and removal of distractions from video sequences.", "text": "mixtures mixtures frey paper review approach extend dynamic graphical time needed exact inference models scales mensions give results volving sequences fast efficiently ence class spatial spatial herent time needed inference learning equivalent images. several incorporated reasonable depend formation image class class current model temporal coherence magnitude factorized shown above. hidden variables states models viewed stan­ dard expectation applied maximum likelihood prior probabilities compute sufficient statistics ities densities straints probabilities. best thmm parameters sequence several formed inference input sequence sensor object probabilistic thmm discrete. also used classify atypical applying generating figure modeling handwritten ponents factor analyzers digit. means components translated ability) digits generated models. mixture factor analyzers digits. case best experiments selected using iterations rameters estimated probabilities observed step. parameter method. fig. shows mean variance tmg. compared simple averaging finds sharper significantly lower duces confident -component iterations ponents images fig. show sheared means. cases transformation image dimmed. means found sharper count line thickness angle. fig. show digits generated since different count different often extra stroke tcas contain unsupervised cluster models could identify tried mixture gaussians analyzers models trained model highest shown fig. compared methods found blurred identifying cluster digit rates much lower error rate fig. shows images \"pac­ movie\". pac-man shapes discernible mouth. learning ficult since levels noise make difficult frames studied man's motion highly pixel direction ability probability changing first fig. shows resulting means second shows pixel variances clusters tensity). tribution noise illustrates ment object background background background gether object cluster contributions class tracking trained independent ances shown left column fig. transformations consisted shifts even though normalize static data learns gate foreground ments occupy many pixels. thmm blindly sult since thmm also determine global illustrate fig. degraded placing dark front back­ ground face performed single above. right fig. show result­ cluster sensor noise estimate. black observation presence estimated high region even though pixels intensi­ ties image. happened fixated face-the largest stant appearance many frames. filled average rest sequence shown right learned column fig. even though parts truck occluded every frame thmm able integrate suppress fig. demonstrate time frame image contains mean shifted given whole observed appears screen forward-backward estimation forces data drops. since transformations summary many learning applications data includes specified case time series transformations generative model must extract interesting describe static transformation manifold discrete model need­ points. model transformations. although time needed method scales manifold dimensionality plored variety learning tained. algorithms including variational to-fine modeling", "year": 2013}
