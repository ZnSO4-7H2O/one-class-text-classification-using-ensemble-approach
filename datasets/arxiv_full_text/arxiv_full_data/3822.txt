{"title": "System Combination for Short Utterance Speaker Recognition", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "For text-independent short-utterance speaker recognition (SUSR), the performance often degrades dramatically. This paper presents a combination approach to the SUSR tasks with two phonetic-aware systems: one is the DNN-based i-vector system and the other is our recently proposed subregion-based GMM-UBM system. The former employs phone posteriors to construct an i-vector model in which the shared statistics offers stronger robustness against limited test data, while the latter establishes a phone-dependent GMM-UBM system which represents speaker characteristics with more details. A score-level fusion is implemented to integrate the respective advantages from the two systems. Experimental results show that for the text-independent SUSR task, both the DNN-based i-vector system and the subregion-based GMM-UBM system outperform their respective baselines, and the score-level system combination delivers performance improvement.", "text": "abstract—for text-independent short-utterance speaker recognition performance often degrades dramatically. paper presents combination
