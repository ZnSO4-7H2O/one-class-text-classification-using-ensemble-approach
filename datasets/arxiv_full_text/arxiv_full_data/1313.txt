{"title": "Deep learning for class-generic object detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "We investigate the use of deep neural networks for the novel task of class generic object detection. We show that neural networks originally designed for image recognition can be trained to detect objects within images, regardless of their class, including objects for which no bounding box labels have been provided. In addition, we show that bounding box labels yield a 1% performance increase on the ImageNet recognition challenge.", "text": "investigate deep neural networks novel task class-generic object
