{"title": "Learning to Generate Posters of Scientific Papers", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.MM", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Researchers often summarize their work in the form of posters. Posters provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas from scientific papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed. Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good poster, including panel layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively labelled panels and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of our approach.", "text": "yuting qiang yanwei yanwen guo† zhi-hua zhou leonid sigal national laboratory novel software technology nanjing university nanjing china {qiangyuting.newywguo.nju}gmail.com zhouzhnju.edu.cn {yanwei.fulsigal}disneyresearch.com automatic tools scientiﬁc poster generation would help researchers providing easier effectively share research. further given avid amount scientiﬁc papers arxiv on-line repositories tools also provide researchers consume content easily. rather browsing papers able browse automatically generated poster previews however order generate scientiﬁc poster accordance with representative original paper many problems need solved content extraction. important textual graphical content needs extracted original paper;
