{"title": "Multi-Label Classification Method Based on Extreme Learning Machines", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "In this paper, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based technique for Multi-label classification problems is proposed and discussed. In multi-label classification, each of the input data samples belongs to one or more than one class labels. The traditional binary and multi-class classification problems are the subset of the multi-label problem with the number of labels corresponding to each sample limited to one. The proposed ELM based multi-label classification technique is evaluated with six different benchmark multi-label datasets from different domains such as multimedia, text and biology. A detailed comparison of the results is made by comparing the proposed method with the results from nine state of the arts techniques for five different evaluation metrics. The nine methods are chosen from different categories of multi-label methods. The comparative results shows that the proposed Extreme Learning Machine based multi-label classification technique is a better alternative than the existing state of the art methods for multi-label problems.", "text": "recent years several techniques developed available literature used perform multi-label classification. gjorgi paper categorizes techniques three major categories. extensive

bipolar step function. threshold applied resultant values. columns resulting matrix values gives multi-label belongingness corresponding input. degree multi-label nature data varies. data sets large part input data multi-label nature whereas data sets multi-label samples. degree multi-label nature quantified using metrics label cardinality label density dataset given number labels. then label cardinality defined average number labels input samples dataset. label density given average number labels input samples divided number labels. label cardinality signifies average number labels present training data set. label cardinality independent number labels present dataset. label density takes consideration number labels present dataset. datasets label cardinality different label density differ largely properties cause different behavior training algorithm correct. classification either correct wrong. partial correctness observed single label classification. whereas multi-label classification problems classifier classify least classes correctly classes wrong manner thus resulting partial correctness classification. thus traditional performance evaluation metrics

different datasets. hence consistent performance method critical importance used real-time real world applications. number labels varies labels high labels. datasets number attributes varying high attributes tested verified. multi-label datasets another unique nature datasets equally multi-labelled. multi-label nature datasets varies. degree multi-labelness quantified metrics label cardinality label density. label cardinality gives average number labels input samples dataset. single-label classification label cardinality always multi-label problems input samples label associated them. hence label cardinality multilabel problems always greater datasets used experimental validation proposed method label cardinality varying label cardinality signifies sample average labels associated label density takes account number labels along average number labels input samples. lower label density lesser number occurrence label dataset. lower label density indicates fewer samples corresponding label hence learning method needs learn label within limited samples. thus label density indicates average percentage occurrence label dataset datasets taken keel multi-label dataset repository.
