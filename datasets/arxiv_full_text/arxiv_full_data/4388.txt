{"title": "Prostate Cancer Diagnosis using Deep Learning with 3D Multiparametric  MRI", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "A novel deep learning architecture (XmasNet) based on convolutional neural networks was developed for the classification of prostate cancer lesions, using the 3D multiparametric MRI data provided by the PROSTATEx challenge. End-to-end training was performed for XmasNet, with data augmentation done through 3D rotation and slicing, in order to incorporate the 3D information of the lesion. XmasNet outperformed traditional machine learning models based on engineered features, for both train and test data. For the test data, XmasNet outperformed 69 methods from 33 participating groups and achieved the second highest AUC (0.84) in the PROSTATEx challenge. This study shows the great potential of deep learning for cancer imaging.", "text": "novel deep learning architecture based convolutional neural networks developed classification prostate cancer lesions using multiparametric data provided prostatex challenge. end-to-end training performed xmasnet data augmentation done rotation slicing order incorporate information lesion. xmasnet outperformed traditional machine learning models based engineered features train test data. test data xmasnet outperformed methods participating groups achieved second highest prostatex challenge. study shows great potential deep learning cancer imaging. prostate cancer second common type cancer men. estimated cases deaths caused prostate cancer screening prostate cancer using prostate specific antigen test digital rectal examination limited diagnostic accuracy lead overdiagnosis. although prostate cancer usually direct cause death differentiation clinically significant prostate cancer lesions low-grade lesions critical. multiparametric prostate imaging reporting data system increased sensitivity prostate cancer detection specificity still poor lead unnecessary biopsies. accuracy mpmri pi-rads also largely dependent experience radiologist. last years several machine learning algorithms proposed based engineered features. however feature engineering usually requires significant amount domain expertise hence accuracies models highly variable depending quality engineered features. advent deep convolutional neural network techniques great success natural image classification. medical imaging however effectiveness deep learning hampered major challenges heterogeneous data relatively small sample size. paper challenges conquered proper data preprocessing data augmentation. develop deep architecture performed end-to-end training xmasnet multiparametric images prostate cancer diagnosis. rest paper organized follows. section describes details data preprocessing data augmentation. section presents architecture xmasnet end-to-end training. section shows feature engineering training conventional machine learning model. results discussions provided section conclusions future directions given section study cases including training cases labels lesions given. case diffusion weighted images apparent diffusion coefficient maps ktrans well weighted images least lesion present case locations lesions provided. three major steps data preprocessing standardization. images acquired different parameters interpolated isotropic resolution using linear interpolation. case different types images co-registered using transverse reference. refining lesion center. lesion region obtained region growing morphological operations using dwi. center lesion refined centroid obtained region. train/validation sample preparation. five cases removed training data relatively image quality. remaining cases split train validation sets using stratified splitting. specifically cases training cases validation. four different types inputs generated using different combinations ktrans transverse channels type input least deep learning model trained. data augmentation done rotation slicing. particularly sliced lesion different orientations. slice in-plane rotation random shearing translation lesion pixel also performed. train samples prepared sample corresponding region interest surrounding lesion center. training using caffe random mirroring also performed fly. augmentation procedure also applied validation test sets. lesion test final prediction average predictions made different orientations. multi-view technique reformulates problem problem enables incorporation information inputs. figure examples four types input images xmasnet. main text definitions input types. illustration data augmentation slicing. illustration data augmentation in-plane rotation. dashed shows cropped region interest centered lesion. deep learning architecture named xmasnet built study. xmasnet inspired net. input output sizes layer listed table end-to-end training xmasnet carried instance. figure architecture xmasnet. conv convolutional layer;
