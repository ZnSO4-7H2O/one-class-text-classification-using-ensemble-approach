{"title": "An Embarrassingly Simple Speed-Up of Belief Propagation with Robust  Potentials", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "We present an exact method of greatly speeding up belief propagation (BP) for a wide variety of potential functions in pairwise MRFs and other graphical models. Specifically, our technique applies whenever the pairwise potentials have been {\\em truncated} to a constant value for most pairs of states, as is commonly done in MRF models with robust potentials (such as stereo) that impose an upper bound on the penalty assigned to discontinuities; for each of the $M$ possible states in one node, only a smaller number $m$ of compatible states in a neighboring node are assigned milder penalties. The computational complexity of our method is $O(mM)$, compared with $O(M^2)$ for standard BP, and we emphasize that the method is {\\em exact}, in contrast with related techniques such as pruning; moreover, the method is very simple and easy to implement. Unlike some previous work on speeding up BP, our method applies both to sum-product and max-product BP, which makes it useful in any applications where marginal probabilities are required, such as maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the technique on a stereo MRF example, confirming that the technique speeds up BP without altering the solution.", "text": "introduction belief propagation applied wide variety problems computer vision pattern recognition graphical models including stereo optical flow tracking shape matching protein folding provides tractable method performing inference variety graphical models computational complexity still scales square state space size related pruning/beam search techniques dynamically remove available states variable graphical model belief slow practical applications. method method approximates gaussian potential function repeatedly convolving small number filters much less general approach reduces required memory storage. like technique exploits sparse compatibility property potentials; however unlike ours speed-up guaranteed general experimental results demonstrate approach sum‚Äêproduct applied simple pairwise stereo model similar implemented model described briefly follows. unknown disparity experiment validate fact approach speeds without altering results. note speed-up factors order magnitude larger would result disparity range relative coughlan shen dynamic quantization belief propagation sparse spaces. computer vision image understanding special issue generative-model based vision lafferty j.d. mccallum pereira f.c.n. conditional random fields probabilistic models segmenting labeling sequence data. icml proceedings eighteenth international comparative study energy minimization methods markov random fields smoothnessbased priors. ieee transactions pattern analysis machine intelligence", "year": 2010}
