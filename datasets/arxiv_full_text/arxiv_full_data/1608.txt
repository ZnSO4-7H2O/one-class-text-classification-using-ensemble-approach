(Moulin-Frier et al., 2015). Based on the analysis of mathematical models of the origins of speech forms, with a focus on their assumptions , we study the fundamental question of how speech can be formed out of non--speech, at both developmental and evolutionary scales. In particular, we emphasize the importance of embodied self-organization , as well as the role of mechanisms of motivation and active curiosity-driven exploration in speech formation. Finally , we discuss an evolutionary-developmental perspective of the origins of speech.", "text": "abstract article discusses open scientific challenges understanding development evolution speech

motivational mechanisms? specific speech language result fundamental developmental process? interestingly observations infant vocal behavior show infants explore sound production even absence peers

neuroscience beginning identify brain circuits involved spontaneous exploratory behaviors curiosity-­‐ driven learning fruitful line computational models considering intrinsically motivated exploration driven search learning progress niches learner viewed little scientist trying understand body relations environment actively selecting experiments improve quality predictive model i.e.

articulated proto-­‐syllables. vocal learner becomes proficient producing complex sounds imitating vocalizations peers starts provide high learning progress explaining automatic shift self-­‐exploration vocal imitation. thus model speech structures develop result form curiosity-­‐driven exploration connected function speech communication. optimization process optimization driven speech communication purpose. another line work studying role emotional social reinforcement explored pre-­‐speech mechanisms help build ground speech communication forms. oller example discussed depth functional flexibility early speech sounds particular initially bootstrapped extrinsic motivation share express emotions social peers. computational model warlaumont showed non-­‐linguistic social reinforcement could progressively drive vocal learner produce syllable-­‐like vocalizations. howard messum complementarily explored social reinforcement could lead vocal learner acquire match adult speech forms. lines work suggest intrinsic extrinsic forms motivations specifically geared towards speech communication play early important role carving forms vocalizations transform later speech major open challenge appears understand model full account transition non-­‐speech systems speech communication systems. example open question understand intrinsically motivated learner discovers speech sounds curiosity-­‐driven exploration and/or social process sharing emotions could discover sounds also used tools manipulate others coordinate them shaped negotiated cultural evolution process alike cosmo model. sensorimotor learning point view developing skills produce controlled sounds vocal tract shares similar challenges learning skills like reaching legged locomotion object manipulation. indeed learning sensorimotor spaces difficult spaces high-­‐dimensional non-­‐ linear; learning happens incrementally physical experiments physical experiments costly time energy. consequence random exploration sensorimotor spaces i.e. random babbling bound fail leading collection sparse sensorimotor observations cannot used infer regularities underlying manifolds thus exploration needs guided. could wonder whether exists guiding mechanisms specific vocal exploration exploration locomotion exploration object manipulation exploration. maybe beginning specific

section discussed particular intrinsic motivation social reinforcement mechanisms could guide vocal development. guiding mechanisms fact orthogonal speech shown highly efficient guiding development

legged locomotion high-­‐dimensional body learn object manipulation actively choose help human teachers moulin-­‐ frier showed active exploration mechanisms could self-­‐organize developmental path certain speech forms appear particular order timing similarly formation sensorimotor forms certain order shown modalities. baranes oudeyer specific coordination structures leading robot walk backwards

fact general guiding mechanisms across modalities sensorimotor learning. closely related mechanisms example shown human could reinforcement signals progressively shape exploration learning balancing object controlling combining objects reach goal previous sections seen non-­‐speech mechanisms play fundamental role progressively guiding young learner discovering his/her vocal tract produce speech

communication difficult scientific challenge remains explain child flexibly discovers means goals speech communication i.e. child comes understand master certain behaviors produces used flexibly adaptively social peers respond. non-­‐speech mechanisms impact speech development also understanding language languages form cultural evolutionary scale. discussed above models speech language

cultural phylogenetic evolutionary scales understand origins language itself populations individual invent shape means goals language? argued oudeyer smith important consider non-­‐speech developmental mechanisms help child discover speech also instrumental helping populations individuals invent language. example behavioural innovations resulting curiosity-­‐driven sensorimotor
