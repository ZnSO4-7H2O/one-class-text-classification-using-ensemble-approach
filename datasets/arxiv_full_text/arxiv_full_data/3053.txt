{"title": "Spatio-Temporal Data Mining: A Survey of Problems and Methods", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.DB"], "abstract": "Large volumes of spatio-temporal data are increasingly collected and studied in diverse domains including, climate science, social sciences, neuroscience, epidemiology, transportation, mobile health, and Earth sciences. Spatio-temporal data differs from relational data for which computational approaches are developed in the data mining community for multiple decades, in that both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to the actual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introduces additional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data mining community. In this article we present a broad survey of this relatively young field of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of spatio-temporal data and the relevant data mining questions that arise in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the data mining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mining into six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection, frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discuss the various forms of spatio-temporal data mining problems in each of these categories.", "text": "gowtham atluri∗ university cincinnati anuj karpatne∗ university minnesota vipin kumar

data types representations leads multiple ways formulating stdm problems methods. section first describe generic properties data describe basic types data available different applications. building discussion describe common ways defining representing data instances generic methods computing similarity among different types instances. auto-correlation. domains involving data observations made nearby locations time stamps independent correlated other. auto-correlation data sets results coherence spatial observations smoothness temporal observations result classical data mining algorithms assume independence among observations well-suited applications often resulting poor performance salt-and-pepper errors further standard evaluation schemes cross-validation become invalid presence data test error rate contaminated training error rate random sampling approaches used generate training test sets correlated other. also need novel ways evaluating predictions stdm methods estimates location/time object useful even exact close vicinity ground-truth labels. hence need account structure auto-correlation among observations analyzing data sets. heterogeneity. another basic assumption made classical data mining formulations homogeneity instances implies every instance belongs population thus identically distributed. however data sets show heterogeneity space time varying ways levels. example satellite measurements vegetation location earth show cyclical pattern time presence seasonal cycles. hence observations made winter differently distributed observations made summer. also inter-annual changes regime shifts earth’s climate e.g. nino phase transitions impact climate patterns change global scale. another example different spatial regions brain perform different functions hence show varying physiological responses stimuli. heterogeneity space time requires learning different models varying spatio-temporal regions. data types variety data types encounter different real-world applications. differ space time used process data collection representation lead different categories stdm problem formulations. reason important establish type data available given application make effective stdm methods. following describe four common categories data types event data comprises discrete events occurring point locations times trajectory data trajectories moving bodies measured point reference data continuous field measured moving reference sites raster data observations field collected fixed cells grid first data types record observations discrete events objects next data types capture information continuous discrete fields. discuss basic properties four data types using illustrative examples diverse applications. indeed data collected native data type different intend cases possible convert data type another e.g. point reference data raster data. briefly discuss possible ways converting data type data types leveraging stdm methods developed data types particular application. event data. event generally characterized point location time denotes event occurred respectively. example crime event characterized location crime along time crime activity occurred. similarly disease outbreak represented using location time patient first infected. collection point events called spatial point pattern spatial statistics literature. figure shows example spatial point pattern two-dimensional euclidean coordinate system denotes location time point event. note apart location time information every event also contain non-st variables known marked variables provide additional information every event. example events belong different types type disease nature crime denoted categorical marked variable. figure marked variable events take three categorical values events quite common real-world applications criminology epidemiology transportation earth science social media spatial nature events represented using euclidean coordinate system sometimes relevant explore alternative representations data. example accidents freeways considered events occurring spatial road network distance events measured euclidean distance shortest distance road segments connecting events. further events always point objects space instead characterized geometric shapes lines polygons. example forest fire event represented spatial polygon delineates extent damage fire. similarly event instantaneous time point occurrence instead associated time period appearance denoting birth death event. example music concert happening city represented using start times event. simple extensions events quite common real-world applications existing stdm methods tailored analyzing point events occurring euclidean spaces. trajectory data. trajectories denote paths traced bodies moving space time. examples trajectories include route taken taxi pick-up drop-off location migration patterns animals traveling better access food water shelter trajectory data commonly collected mounting sensors moving bodies periodically transmits information location body time. figure illustrates trajectories three moving bodies apart measuring series locations traversed every moving body time trajectory data also contain additional marked variables moving body heart-rate person running circuit track sequence messages transmitted received patrolling police car. trajectories common applications transportation ecology enforcement. point reference data. point reference data consists measurements continuous field temperature vegetation population moving reference points space time. example meteorological variables temperature humidity commonly measured using weather balloons floating space continuously record weather observations point locations space time. another example buoy sensors used measuring ocean variables surface temperature locations keep changing time. examples finite sample reference points used represent

points used reconstruct field arbitrary location time using data-driven methods physics-based methods point reference data also known geostatistical data spatial statistics literature. raster data. raster data measurements continuous discrete field recorded fixed locations space fixed points time. contrast point reference data reference sites keep changing location time collect recordings different time stamps. formally describe raster consider fixed locations either distributed regularly space constant distance adjacent locations e.g. pixels image distributed irregular spatial pattern e.g. ground-based sensor networks every location record observations fixed time stamps regularly spaced equal delays consecutive measurements irregularly spaced cartesian product results complete spatio-temporal grid every vertex grid distinct measurement. raster data quite common several real-world applications remote sensing climate science brain imaging epidemiology demography. examples raster data include measurements collected ground-based sensors fields quality weather information geo-registered images earth’s surface collected satellites regular revisit times fmri video sequences brain activity. note examples raster record observations point vertices others make aggregate measurements region every grid cell. example demographic information often collected aggregate scales political divisions cities counties districts states annual scale. another feature raster data resolution grid used collecting measurements. many applications commonly encounters raster data sets varying resolutions space time collected different instruments sensors. example satellite measurements earth’s surface obtained landsat instruments meter spatial resolution every days modis instruments meter spatial resolution daily scale. another example fmri technology used measure brain activity location whereas technology fig. different aspects grids used representing raster data. locations raster either located regularly irregularly space. time stamps also either spaced regularly irregularly. measures activity selected tens locations. problems involving rasters varying resolutions often need convert raster native resolution finer coarser resolution seamless analysis rasters performed common resolution. interpolation techniques also referred resampling methods geographic information system literature commonly used convert raster data finer resolution space time. note computational requirements stdm methods generally increase move finer resolutions space time. raster data also converted coarser resolution aggregating collections cells. aggregation generally helps removing redundancies observations especially high spatial temporal auto-correlation finer resolutions. however important keep mind aggressive aggregation data coarser resolutions result loss information field measured. converting data types. even data naturally collected particular data type certain application possible transform different type relevant family stdm tools used analyses. provide examples inter-conversion among data types following. event data type converted raster data type aggregating counts events every cell grid. example crime events counted levels counties city hourly scale thus producing raster crime occurrences. cases raster data also converted events using special algorithms event extraction e.g. techniques find regions abnormal activity. example ecosystem disturbance events forest fires extracted geo-registered satellite images vegetation cover another common type conversion among data types point reference data raster data. observations reference points transformed raster format interpolating aggregating grid. raster data also converted point reference data every vertex grid viewed reference point. data instances basic unit data data mining algorithm operates upon called data instance. classical data mining settings data instance unambiguously represented observed features optional supervised labels. however context data multiple ways defining instances given data type resulting different stdm formulation. section review five

similarity structure among time-series brain regions could different. cases desired pattern similarity among time-series exhibited short periods time need determined data. example approach simultaneously identifies relevant spatial similarity. spatial maps considered similar show similar values corresponding locations captured using standard proximity measures euclidean distance. however spatial maps often suffer small misalignments geo-registration errors result misleading distance metrics. further often useful compute similarity smaller sub-regions contain foreground objects considering similarity entire map. earth’s mover distance metric robust changes alignment images based minimal cost must paid transform image other. spatial similarity also computed basis features image segments extracted data. raster similarity. network-based representations rasters used assess rasters similar not. example link node similarity scores used compute similarity among corresponding
