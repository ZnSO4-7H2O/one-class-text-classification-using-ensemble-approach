{"title": "Movie Recommendation Systems Using An Artificial Immune System", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "We apply the Artificial Immune System (AIS) technology to the Collaborative Filtering (CF) technology when we build the movie recommendation system. Two different affinity measure algorithms of AIS, Kendall tau and Weighted Kappa, are used to calculate the correlation coefficients for this movie recommendation system. From the testing we think that Weighted Kappa is more suitable than Kendall tau for movie problems.", "text": "movie recommendation systems implemented using collaborative filtering technology uses weighted kappa method calculate correlation coefficients uses kendall method. built select group people similar movie preferences target. people database viewed candidate antibodies movie recommendation system viewed antigen. correlation methods used calculate correlations antigen antibodies correlations antibodies antibodies. artificial immune system apply technology technology build movie recommendation system. different affinity measure algorithms kendall weighted kappa used calculate correlation coefficients movie recommendation system. testing think weighted kappa suitable kendall movie problems. everyday life often face situation need make choices without sufficient personal experience. arising needs call effective recommendation systems assist making choices. today’s techniques used recommendation systems mainly collaborative filtering technology content-based collaborative filtering technology implied used project. correlation methods weighted kappa kendall used calculate correlation coefficients results compared. technology offering users recommendations getting recommendations people similar preferences collaborative technology offer recommendations items even though know content items. advantage. group people similar preferences user entirely determine predictions user request recommendation important choose group people. represents observed agreements represents expected agreements chance. movie recommendation systems persons person database chose movies seen movie database ranked them. agreements chance exist calculated equation represents category. represents number observations categories. represent number agreements cell column represents weight value cell column project category observations number number movies persons seen common equation example person person seen movies common observations number movie movie movie movie movie movie movie person vote person vote movie person vote person vote movie person vote person vote model used project immune network model built farmer modified cayzer model controlled equation describes antibody’s concentration changes. increases antibody’s matching antibody’s matching antibodies. exist death rate antibody neither good concentration also decrease. antibody’s concentration value delete choose another antibody randomly database. antibodies satisfy requirement antibodies chosen database updating process stop. represents concentration antigen represents concentration antibody represent concentration antibody represents affinity antibody represents affinity antibody antigen calculating affinity pair observations view concordant pair xj-xi yj-yi sign; view discordant pair xj-xi yj-yi opposite signs. represents number concordant pairs; number discordant pairs. equation used coefficient) represents observations number represents kendall defined observations pairs either concordant discordant. concordant discordant number concordant pairs within pairs represent probability concordant represents probability pair discordant. figure shows prediction accuracy users using movie recommendation system uses correlation method. mean kendall prediction accuracy prediction accuracy calculated using equation votescorei represents score antibody voted movie concentration weight calculate prediction contains correlation antibody antigen correlation antibody antibodies. figure figure shows prediction accuracy users using movie recommendation system uses weighted kappa correlation method mean prediction accuracy accuracy represents rank difference prediction user’s actual rating movie. system predicts movie ‘very good’ user think ‘good’. order calculate prediction accuracy choose persons randomly database hide votes person offer person prediction hidden movie using information left. times person chosen hiding different vote compare predictions hidden actual votes. leandro castro jonathan timmis ‘artificial immune systems computational intelligence approach’ goldsby r.a. lindt t.j. osborne b.a. kuby ‘immunology’ fifth edition pp-. system uses kendall method antibodies user weighted kappa method calculate correlations antibodies antigens. compare correlations kappa kendall. results shown figure found kendall method movie recommendation systems ignore pairs treat zero opposite number negative number kendall value different calculate different orders. obviously wrong. ignore pairs zero much information ignore. think problem categories observations comparisons) movie problems. kendall calculate correlations many tires. opinions kendall suitable movies problems; kappa good method movies problems.", "year": 2008}
