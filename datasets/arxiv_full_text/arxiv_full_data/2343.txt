{"title": "IPF for Discrete Chain Factor Graphs", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), combined with EM, is commonly used as an algorithm for likelihood maximization in undirected graphical models. In this paper, we present two iterative algorithms that generalize upon IPF. The first one is for likelihood maximization in discrete chain factor graphs, which we define as a wide class of discrete variable models including undirected graphical models and Bayesian networks, but also chain graphs and sigmoid belief networks. The second one is for conditional likelihood maximization in standard undirected models and Bayesian networks. In both algorithms, the iteration steps are expressed in closed form. Numerical simulations show that the algorithms are competitive with state of the art methods.", "text": "proportional iterative bined commonly gorithm rected graphical present alize upon ipf. first likelihood maximization define wide class discrete variable ical models bayesian chain graphs sigmoid second conditional maximization bayesian iteration form. numerical algorithms methods. bayesian bers larger described potentials. chain graphs directed networks works conditional understood potentials ents. parameterized tance maximum likelihood robust define wide model class contains ously mentioned model classes them. model class combines factor factor probabilistic tablished uncertainty ical model often consists determination usually edge. second step network determined paper focuses fixed structure since substitution formulate likelihood loop iteration unconditional clamped parents. present joint parent chain graphs tion of>. make sure potentials normalized. results figure log-likelihood typical visited exactly ately updated. first computing line minimization tion. computational partial costs cycle ipf. experimentally computational costs cycle three times costs ipf. costly left plot initially number cycles remains three methods converge similar panel shows mean standard difference log-likelihood significantly better seems significant ically obtained rior compared illustrate bayesian agnosis well known coronary heart disease patient. bility ical symptom disease pain). constructed information publication distributed example heart-disease four states ample states false) pain atypical independent dent given graphical figure based conditional probabilities note 'di­ data tabulated rections' model figure -which inter­ preted conditional linear upper structions likelihood sented construction mixture expressions. using reverse jensen procedure quadratic variables definition local potentials tually maximized upon standard graphs addition itive performance methods.", "year": 2012}
