LDAGs generalize earlier proposals for allowing local structures in the conditional probability distribution of a node, such that unrestricted label sets determine which edges can be deleted from the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) for a given context. Several properties of these models are derived, including a generalization of the concept of Markov equivalence classes. Efficient Bayesian learning of LDAGs is enabled by introducing an LDAG-based factorization of the Dirichlet prior for the model parameters, such that the marginal likelihood can be calculated analytically. In addition, we develop a novel prior distribution for the model structures that can appropriately penalize a model for its labeling complexity. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm combined with a greedy hill climbing approach is used for illustrating the useful properties of LDAG models for both real and synthetic data sets.",

directed graph built nodes directed edges. acyclic property ensures directed path starting node leads back particular node. concept dagbased graphical models bayesian networks formalized pearl bayesian network nodes represent variables directed edges represent direct dependencies among variables. correspondingly absence edges represents statements conditional independence. constraints

person approaches building guard note gender whether person wears badge spies mostly men. spies always wear badges attempt fool guard. visitors don’t wear badges don’t one. female workers tend wear

idea introduce graph topology able visualize local csis directly part single graph structure done figure achieve labels edges similar corander enables incorporation local csis single graph opposed multiple networks -approaches might need graph distinct context. ldag formally deﬁned labels representing local csis. respect ﬁxed ordering variables labels contain variable indices contains parental

generalizing bayesian networks utilizes fact local csis correspond certain regularities among cpds arising factorization focus therefore diﬀerent ways representing cpds. boutilier decision trees certain local csi-structures captured natural way. however replication problem trees somewhat limited expression power comes certain types csi-structure. chickering overcome shortcoming using general type representation form decision graphs. unfortunately decision graphs usually leave scope complicating interpretability models dependence perspective. addition models lack ability exploit inference. next investigate treedecision graph-based approaches connected ldag representation fact considered compromise representations. ldags allow expressive models cpt-trees without leaving scope provides natural interpretation proven computational advantages performing inference. numbers parents fails capture regularities present cpds. including local csis model however directly implies certain cpds

balancing expressive power models interpretability. sound interpretation arises naturally various situations. computational perspective also proven particularly useful probabilistic inference. considerable research eﬀorts devoted outlining exploited probabilistic inference. probabilistic inference refers process computing posterior probability list query variables given observed variables. eﬃcient inference lies concept factorization joint distribution. incorporating local csis models allows decomposition ﬁner-grained factorization turn speed inference. boutilier investigate cpt-trees

approach suitable problem hand. inference exploits quite thoroughly investigated numerous authors. paper thus focus model identiﬁability learning. practical point view might argue sole existence expressive eﬃcient models enough models cannot accurately learned data. expressive models harder learning tends added ﬂexibility. section present bayesian learning scheme ldags ﬁrst attend aspect model identiﬁability interpretability. facilitate interpretation csi-structure ldags utilize conditions introduced labeled undirected graphical models corander maximality regularity. given local

ldag. independence assertions recovered directly indirectly structure ldag divided local non-local. local follow directed local markov property local csis attained labels. local independencies associated denoted iloc. addition local independencies additional non-local independencies derived iloc. local nonlocal independencies denoted fully describes dependence structure however dependence structure ldag still ultimately determined local independencies since non-local independencies implictly represented iloc. denote distribution variables ldag denote csis satisﬁed factorizes according must hold iloc derivation non-local ordinary dags cumbersome. instead non-local veriﬁed utilizing concept -separation. boutilier introduce sound counterpart context-speciﬁc independence; csi-separation. reduce problem checking csi-separation checking ordinary variable independence simpler context-speciﬁc graph. formulate concept csi-separation ldags following notions introduced. unfortunately complete sense arise situations certain structure induced independencies cannot discovered directly csi-separation algorithm. koller friedman noticed necessary perform reasoning cases recover -separation based notion active trails i.e. trails along information variable another lack trails imply -separation. labels ldag ability active trail certain context removing edge render trail

indeed holds structural properties ldag. several csi-separation statements work together order achieve non-local independence easily discovered. however situations special cases arise complete outcome
