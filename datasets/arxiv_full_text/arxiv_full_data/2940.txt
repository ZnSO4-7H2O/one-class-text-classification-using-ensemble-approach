{"title": "AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We introduce The House Of inteRactions (THOR), a framework for visual AI research, available at http://ai2thor.allenai.org. AI2-THOR consists of near photo-realistic 3D indoor scenes, where AI agents can navigate in the scenes and interact with objects to perform tasks. AI2-THOR enables research in many different domains including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, learning by interaction, planning, visual question answering, unsupervised representation learning, object detection and segmentation, and learning models of cognition. The goal of AI2-THOR is to facilitate building visually intelligent models and push the research forward in this domain.", "text": "allows better transfer learned models real world. instance atari

agent collides object navigation action agent reset previous position. action discrete command agent perform within scene actions fail pre-conditions met. example ‘open microwave’ action fail microwave vicinity agent. object object model inside scene. objects static movable example static object cabinet attached wall example movable object statue. ancategorization objects interactable noninteractable. non-interactable objects mainly generating clutter making scenes realistic. example interactable object drawer opened closed example noninteractable object sticky note fridge. noninteractable objects included metadata server sends. categories interactable objects. interactable object contains number variations. example different types bread. randomizer used change location objects. variant object selected scene deterministic based scene number. receptacles type object contain objects. receptacles predetermined locations objects placed called pivots. receptacle pivots pivot cannot hold object time. attempts object full receptacle result failure. multiple vacant pivots ﬁrst available selected object reside. sinks refrigerators cabinets tabletops examples
