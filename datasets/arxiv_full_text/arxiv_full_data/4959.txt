{"title": "Taste or Addiction?: Using Play Logs to Infer Song Selection Motivation", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Online music services are increasing in popularity. They enable us to analyze people's music listening behavior based on play logs. Although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of topic. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people's music listening behavior. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist's songs are listened to by people, etc. We also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.", "text": "abstract. online music services increasing popularity. enable analyze people’s music listening behavior based play logs. although known people listen music based topic assume user addicted artist s/he chooses artist’s songs regardless topic. based assumption paper propose probabilistic model analyze people’s music listening behavior. main contributions threefold. first best knowledge ﬁrst study modeling music listening behavior taking account inﬂuence addiction artists. second using real-world datasets play logs showed effectiveness proposed model. third carried qualitative experiments showed taking addiction account enables analyze music listening behavior viewpoint terms people listen music according time artist’s songs listened people etc. also discuss possibility applying analysis results applications artist similarity computation song recommendation. among various leisure activities watching movies reading books eating delicious food listening music important people terms amount accessible music advent online music services made possible people access millions songs internet become popular play music using services rather physical media like users play music online services record personal musical play logs show users listen music listen since personal music play logs become available become popular session information analyze model people’s music listening behavior here session sequence logs within given time frame. zheleva ﬁrst model listening behavior using topic model based session information. revealed user tends choose songs session according session’s speciﬁc topic rock jazz. however always correct assume user chooses songs according session’s topic. example user buys light above paper proposes model deal session topic addiction artists. proposed model uses model proposed zheleva starting point. present song-listening instance terms corresponding song artist. model user distribution topics reﬂects user’s usual taste music distribution artists reﬂects user’s addiction artists. addition user different ratio usual taste addiction probabilistically chooses song session based ratio. user high addiction ratio s/he probably choose song artist his/her artist distribution addiction. modeling people’s music listening behavior considering addiction worth studying various viewpoints model also show user characteristics many applications could data advertisements recommendation systems. example user chooses songs artist based addiction session would useful recommend songs artist;
