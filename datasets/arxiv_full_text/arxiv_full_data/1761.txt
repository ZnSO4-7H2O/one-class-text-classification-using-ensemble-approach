However, these sources are in general unstructured and, construction of surveillance tools such as taxonomical correlations and trace mapping involves considerable human supervision. In this paper, we motivate a disease vocabulary driven word2vec model (Dis2Vec) to model diseases and constituent attributes as word embeddings from the HealthMap news corpus. We use these word embeddings to automatically create disease taxonomies and evaluate our model against corresponding human annotated taxonomies. We compare our model accuracies against several state-of-the art word2vec methods. Our results demonstrate that Dis2Vec outperforms traditional distributed vector representations in its ability to faithfully capture taxonomical attributes across different class of diseases such as

traditional disease surveillance often relied multitude reporting networks outpatient networks on-ﬁeld healthcare workers lab-based networks. effective tools analyzing mapping diseases especially diseases disease spreading regions reliant building disease taxonomies early detection outbreaks. recent years ready availability social news media services healthmap used track several disease outbreaks news media ranging ebola. however data unstructured often noisy. annotating corpora thus requires considerable human oversight. signiﬁcant information endemic rare diseases extracted news corpora traditional text analytics methods lemmatization tokenization often shallow retain sufﬁcient contextual information. involved methods topic models computationally expensive real-time worldwide surveillance provide simple semantic contexts could used comprehend data. recent years several deep learning based methods wordvec docvec found promising analyzing text corpora. methods trained representative corpus readily used analyze text semantic constructs useful automated taxonomy creation. classical wordvec methods generally unsupervised requiring domain information broad applicability. however highly speciﬁed domains moderate sized corpus classical methods fail meaningful semantic relationships. example determining transmission method salmonella given rabies zoonotic traditional wordvec methods skip-gram model trained healthmap corpus fail meaningful answer motivated problem paper postulate vocabulary driven wordvec algorithm meaningful disease constructs used towards disease knowledge extractions. example aforementioned task vocabulary-driven wordvec algorithm generates word foodborne meaningful context disease knowledge extraction. main contributions
