{"title": "Authorship Attribution through Function Word Adjacency Networks", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "A method for authorship attribution based on function word adjacency networks (WANs) is introduced. Function words are parts of speech that express grammatical relationships between other words but do not carry lexical meaning on their own. In the WANs in this paper, nodes are function words and directed edges stand in for the likelihood of finding the sink word in the ordered vicinity of the source word. WANs of different authors can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov chain and are therefore compared in terms of their relative entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and attribution accuracy is benchmarked across a diverse pool of authors and varying text lengths. This analysis shows that, since function words are independent of content, their use tends to be specific to an author and that the relational data captured by function WANs is a good summary of stylometric fingerprints. Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by methods that rely on word frequencies alone. Further combining WANs with methods that rely on word frequencies alone, results in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources of information encode different aspects of authorial styles.", "text": "abstract—a method authorship attribution based function word adjacency networks introduced. function words parts speech express grammatical relationships words carry lexical meaning

classiﬁcation accuracy function wans introduced section depends choice several variables parameters sentence delimiters stopper symbols window length discount factor function words deﬁning nodes

pick i.e. consider words related appear positions apart other. larger values lead higher computational complexity without increase accuracy since grammatical relations words positions apart rare. order choose function words include generating wans present different approaches static methodology adaptive strategy. static approach consists picking function words frequently used union texts considered attribution build proﬁle attributed. using frequent function words base attribution repeated grammatical structures limit inﬂuence noise introduced unusual sequences words consistent stylometric markers. experiments selecting number functions words yields optimal accuracy. illustration consider fig. attribution texts length words among authors chosen random pool century authors

larger test also vary length proﬁles length texts attributed number candidate authors including function words empirically optimal. adaptive approach still uses common function words adapts number function words used speciﬁc attribution problem. order choose number function words implement repeated leave-one-out cross validation follows. every candidate author concatenate known texts written break collection pieces equal length. build proﬁle author randomly picking pieces them. attribute unused pieces authors utilizing wans function words varying given interval perform cross validation rounds change random selection texts build proﬁles. value maximizes accuracy across trials selected number nodes wans. perform attributions using corresponding word wans proﬁles well texts attributed. numerical experiments found using nmin nmax varying depending available computation time sufﬁcient values yield good performance. dashed line fig. represents accuracy obtained implementing adaptive

proﬁles built several sources texts attribute correspond single literary creation. given proﬁle size number authors several attribution experiments randomly choosing authors among century randomly

among large number authors reasonably large corpora available build author proﬁles words. e.g. proﬁle containing words method achieves accuracy binary attributions whereas corresponding random accuracy expected accuracy decreases number candidate authors increases. e.g. proﬁles words accuracy obtained binary attributions whereas accuracy obtained pool candidates contains authors. observe

considered separately. voting decreases error even combining relational data wans frequency data methods. tion words methods consider number times author uses different function words unlike wans contemplate order function words appear. common techniques include naive bayes nearest neighbors decision trees support vector machines table inform percentage errors obtained different methods attributing texts words among proﬁles words number authors ranging ten. given number candidate authors randomly pick pool century authors attribute excerpts using different methods. repeat random choice authors times average error rate. methods based function word frequencies pick parameters preprocessing minimize attribution error rate. e.g. error minimized considering polynomial kernel degree normalizing frequencies text length. nearest neighbors method consider strategies based three nearest neighbors given metric euclidean space. also decision trees consider types split criteria gini diversity index cross-entropy wans achieve lower attribution error frequency based methods; table xii. binary attributions naive bayes achieve error rates respectively thus outperform nearest neighbors decision trees. however wans outperform aforementioned methods obtaining error rate implies reduction error rate. authors wans achieve error rate outperform svms achieving entailing reduction. trend consistent across different number candidate authors wans achieving average error reduction compared best traditional machine learning method. important fact wans tend outperform methods based word frequencies fact carry different stylometric information. thus combine methodologies increase attribution accuracy. last column table inform error rate majority voting wans best performing frequency based methods namely naive bayes svms. error rates consistently smaller achieved wans hence frequency based methods well. e.g. attributions among four authors voting achieves error compared error wans. corresponds reduction error. averaging among attributions different number candidate authors majority voting entails reduction compared wans. combination wans function word frequencies halves attribution error rate respect current state art. relational data function words used stylometric information solve authorship attribution problems. normalized word adjacency networks used relational structures. interpreted networks markov chains order facilitate comparison using relative entropies. accuracy wans analyzed varying number candidate authors text lengths proﬁle lengths different levels heterogeneity among candidate authors regarding genre gender time period. method works best corpora known texts substantial length texts attributed long number
