{"title": "Image Segmentation in Video Sequences: A Probabilistic Approach", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "\"Background subtraction\" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a timeaveraged background image will leave only nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using an unsupervised technique- an efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.", "text": "view problems pixel task. would like classify image moving object shadow basic idea paper classify using probabilistic model pixel looks part different road pixel shadow looks different sunlight pixel shadow independent casting atively probabilistic used update models appropriately pixels traffic moving slowly. \"background finding moving objects example subtracting averaged stationary proximation current objects moving objects. classify pixel looks part different classes. fication vised technique-an sion unlike standard approach component membership; handled eliminates techniques plication traffic surveillance significant tracking. large literature decade several related segmentation include aperture without within image classes field assumption together. typical examples black sawhney consider time. time \"normal\" state-for time shadow moving vehicles time part vehicle. case traffic surveillance values ix.y pixel weighted distributions distributions differ pixel pixel; specific unshadowed essential cause white road markings ters lanes still others lamp-posts weights spend time shadow vehicle botÂ­ roughly right corner image. data display haviour shadow road pixels fairly widely scattered. distribution techniques component mixture fitted scatter reasonably empirical data. model pixel parameterized unfortunately data. thus define likelihood observable mixture values. standard algorithm pectation maximization mclachlan algorithm setting classify parameter process important distribution stationary function. procedure eventually start process several times different setting hope find good approximation application component model labelled shadow vehicle. heuristic problem described standard procedure reviewed requires store values pixel images observed. clearly impractical moreover batch processing possible real-time incremental data. procedure introduced best understood hinton procedure periments sufficient statistics problems long run. never removes contributions sufficient statistics. compute expectation date. thus procedure instances introduce version equation applied incremental process quite straightforwardly. experimenting neal hinton show think process continually iteration previous contribution replace one. thus example update move e>\"' parameter settings pute previous estimated statistics current parameter settings. date remove li(xy instance increases. sample results shown figure show original identified shadow pixels together replacing shadow road value. mask image showing vehicle much cleaner background tion. time writing beginning iments needed show improvement vehicle several fielded. robustness need better models. heuristic extremes prior equivalent evidential support-we state vehicle variance require require little result expect reach limits niques fairly encoded performance. strong constraints enforced hoc. temporal enforced classification schemes markov networks case level models allow extensions e.g. moving cameras higher-level behaviour detect", "year": 2013}
