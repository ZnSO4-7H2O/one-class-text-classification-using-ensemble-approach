{"title": "Improving the Interpretability of Support Vector Machines-based Fuzzy  Rules", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "68U35", "I.2.3"], "abstract": "Support vector machines (SVMs) and fuzzy rule systems are functionally equivalent under some conditions. Therefore, the learning algorithms developed in the field of support vector machines can be used to adapt the parameters of fuzzy systems. Extracting fuzzy models from support vector machines has the inherent advantage that the model does not need to determine the number of rules in advance. However, after the support vector machine learning, the complexity is usually high, and interpretability is also impaired. This paper not only proposes a complete framework for extracting interpretable SVM-based fuzzy modeling, but also provides optimization issues of the models. Simulations examples are given to embody the idea of this paper.", "text": "abstract. support vector machines fuzzy rule systems functionally equivalent conditions. therefore learning algorithms developed ﬁeld support vector machines used adapt parameters fuzzy systems. extracting fuzzy models support vector machines inherent advantage model need determine number rules advance. however support vector machine learning complexity usually high interpretability also impaired. paper proposes complete framework extracting interpretable svm-based fuzzy modeling also provides optimization issues models. simulations examples given embody idea paper. fuzzy systems known superior paradigm processing vague uncertainty information provide clear advantages knowledge representation. operations fuzzy systems heavily depend inference process associated fuzzy rules inference engine. number methods deﬁne fuzzy rule-based modeling discussed literature including heuristic data-driven methods extracting fuzzy models support vector machines ﬁrst investigated order avoid local minimum problem svms utilize quadratic programming optimal separable plane concludes number support vectors proportional preciseness obtained model. words performance derived model acceptable interpretability usually impaired. paper relationship svms fuzzy systems investigated. relationships especially differences models emphasized. argued essential difference svms fuzzy systems interpretability enables fuzzy systems easily comprehensible. based discussions relationships complete framework extracting interpretable fuzzy rules trained svms proposed. rest paper organized follows. relationships svms fuzzy rules proposed algorithm establish interpretable fuzzy models shown section effectiveness scheme demonstrated empirical evaluations section followed conclusions section section first give approach extracting fuzzy rules support vector machine explain optimize fuzzy rules system propose algorithm conversion interpretable fuzzy rules. support vector machine proposed vapnik machine learning method based statistical learning theory useful technique data classification recently introduced technique solving regression estimation problems also used finding fuzzy rules numerical data regression estimation task basic theory briefly presented follows given training data denotes space input patterns. goal support vector regression find function deviation actually obtained targets training data time flat possible. errors would ignored long less deviation larger would accepted. called support vectors. difference linear case longer given explicitly. besides task becomes find flattest function feature space input space. input variables;
