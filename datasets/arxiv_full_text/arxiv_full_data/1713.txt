{"title": "An Approach to Reducing Annotation Costs for BioNLP", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "abstract": "There is a broad range of BioNLP tasks for which active learning (AL) can significantly reduce annotation costs and a specific AL algorithm we have developed is particularly effective in reducing annotation costs for these tasks. We have previously developed an AL algorithm called ClosestInitPA that works best with tasks that have the following characteristics: redundancy in training material, burdensome annotation costs, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) work well for the task, and imbalanced datasets (i.e. when set up as a binary classification problem, one class is substantially rarer than the other). Many BioNLP tasks have these characteristics and thus our AL algorithm is a natural approach to apply to BioNLP tasks.", "text": "xwyk subject significantly reduce annotation costs specific algorithm developed particularly effective reducing annotation costs tasks. previously developed algorithm called closestinitpa works best tasks following characteristics redundancy training material burdensome annotation costs support vector machines work well task imbalanced datasets many bionlp tasks characteristics thus algorithm natural approach apply bionlp tasks. closestinitpa uses svms base learner. fits well many bionlp tasks svms deliver high performance closestinitpa based strategy selecting points closest current modelâ€™s hyperplane human annotation. closestinitpa works best situations imbalanced data often case bionlp tasks. example aimed dataset annotated protein-protein interactions percentage pairs proteins sentence annotated interacting svms learning systems learn linear functions classification. statement optimization problem solved softmargin svms enables asymmetric cost factors following minimize closestinitpa well suited many bionlp tasks. experiments annotation savings practically significant extracting protein-protein interactions classifying medline text performing biomedical named entity recognition. laudio giuliano alberto lavelli lorenza romano. exploiting shallow linguistic information relation extraction biomedical literature. proceedings eacl ki-joong young-sook hwang seonho hae-chang rim. biomedical named entity recognition using two-phase model based svms. journal biomedical informatics simon tong daphne koller. support vector machine active learning applications text classification. jmlr", "year": 2014}
