{"title": "Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-Level Discriminative Patches", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to discover a set of discriminative patches which can serve as a fully unsupervised mid-level visual representation. The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \"visual phrases\", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset.", "text":

question computer vision discipline itself unlikely settled anytime soon. years researchers proposed plethora diﬀerent visual features spanning wide spectrum local full-image low-level semantic terms

requires extraordinarily large amounts training data since needs represent possible spatial conﬁgurations objects world explicitly. result researchers converged using features intermediate scale image patch. even resolution primitive still wide range choices made regarding primitive aims represent. low-level bottom-up point view image patch simply represents appearance point either directly transformed diﬀerent representation blurred spatially-binned feature etc). slightly higher level combining patches together typically clustering histogramming allows represent texture information dense bag-of-words etc). higher still approaches encode image patches sparse interestpoints scalerotation-invariant sift matching overall bottom-up approaches work well problems involving exact instance matching record generalization i.e. ﬁnding similar instances mixed. explanation low-level hard know parts representation important ones could safely ignored. result recently researchers started looking high-level features already impregnated semantic information needed generalize well. example number papers used full-blown object detectors e.g. features describe reason images others employed discriminative part detectors poselets attribute detectors visual phrases stuﬀ detectors features. however signiﬁcant practical barriers wide-spread adaptation top-down semantic techniques. first require non-trivial amounts hand-labeled training data semantic entity second many semantic entities discriminative enough visually good features. example wall well-deﬁned semantic category makes lousy detector simply walls usually plain thus easily discriminable. paper consider mid-level visual primitives adaptable appearance distributions real world low-level features require semantic
