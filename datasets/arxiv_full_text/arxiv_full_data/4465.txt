using features deﬁned single feature hierarchy scale invariance image resolution contextual reasoning. algorithm based foveal descriptors blurring peripheral image encode give enough information context mimicking human vision. subject still open challenge would like experiment approach different applications. thus presenting method inﬂuence parameters concentrate real-world application counting people public demonstration. last part focus possible extensions work. code available github.com/alexattia/extendedtinyfaces difﬁcult impossible detect small faces even human user. thus need establish best encode context. context modelling paper makes ﬁxed-size receptive ﬁeld. deﬁnes templates hypercolumn features extracted multiple layers deep model effective foveal descriptors. technique allows capture high-resolution detail coarse low-resolution cues across large receptive ﬁeld. also tested inﬂuence blur performance tiny faces algorithm. thus experimented widerface

faster r-cnn multi-task cascaded convolutional networks haar cascade histograms oriented gradients tested particular subfolders widerface dataset show results obtained table conclude tiny faces outperforms tested algorithms even dealing many faces. taken counting people public demonstration tedious task would like adapt previous approach automate thus building python pipeline detect count people video demonstration. would consist detecting faces ﬁnding similar ones frames counting people duplicates. application used music video clip public audience partially occluded performer. selected extracts manually annotated clips. goal indeed predict number unique people hence extract count number faces. order match people across frames thus manually match people different frames two. frame rate video assume person radically move frame another. however person might different spatial position frames explains choice using frames second counting people. order count people once recognize face match next frame. obviously ﬁrst needed detect faces frame. applied tiny faces algorithm detection faces hence frame list predicted detected faces. then match across frames. created face embedding face make matching easier wrapped picture faces always direction. face alignement achieved pretrained face landmarks estimation algorithm afﬁne transformations. overcome fact many images face order cheaper algorithm comparison used pretrained face embedding embedding face match faces across frames. would one-vs-all manner i.e. build model predict similar faces frame using simple classiﬁer. train previous ﬁrst needed augment dataset. person radically move frame right after predicted bounding coordinates face next frames. then made data augmentation techniques adding gaussian noise also random values channel using imgaug python library. finally obtained different images face served positive samples training set. negative ones randomly chose faces. training multiple binary classiﬁers frame predicted similar face geographical neighbourhood anframe. classiﬁers used linear svms. eventually similar faces another frame shown figure however threshold respect distance order remove false positives. threshold calculated using crossvalidation maximize f.-score annotated matched faces. finally using previous able build incremental count number unique faces video moving forward. indeed analyzed frame count number detected people remove incremental count number already seen ones number unique people simply people frame paying attention count across

stage headless face detector retinanet. explained above didn’t succeed training algorithm. thus would like train novel pretrained models e.g. resnext better accuracy. also general approach detect tiny objects images focus faces think could apply approach small object calciﬁcations mammography pictures. moreover used simple pipeline approach track count people across frames. future work combining tracking algorithms deepsort conclude recall performed in-depth analysis novel interesting approach understand parts successfully applying counting people public demonstration. able compare tiny faces
