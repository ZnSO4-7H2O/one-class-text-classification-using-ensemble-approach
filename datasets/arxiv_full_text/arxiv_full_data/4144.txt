{"title": "Pixel-Level Domain Transfer", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "We present an image-conditional image generation model. The model transfers an input domain to a target domain in semantic level, and generates the target image in pixel level. To generate realistic target images, we employ the real/fake-discriminator as in Generative Adversarial Nets, but also introduce a novel domain-discriminator to make the generated image relevant to the input image. We verify our model through a challenging task of generating a piece of clothing from an input image of a dressed person. We present a high quality clothing dataset containing the two domains, and succeed in demonstrating decent results.", "text": "abstract. present image-conditional image generation model. model
