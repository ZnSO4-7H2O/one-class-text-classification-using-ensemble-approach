learning techniques recently enabled researchers successfully tackle low-level perception problems supervised learning fashion. ﬁeld reinforcement learning transferred ability develop agents able learn high-dimensional input spaces. particular deep neural networks used help reinforcement learning scale environments visual inputs allowing learn policies testbeds previously completely intractable. instance algorithms deep q-network shown reach human-level performances classic atari games learning controller directly pixels without additional supervision beside score. work spawned area however tackled environments state fully observable reward function delay action relatively small. solve great majority real life problems agents must instead able handle partial observability structured complex dynamics noisy high-dimensional control interfaces. provide community useful research environments work done towards building platforms based videogames torcs mario unreal’s

real-time strategy games historically domain interest planning decision making research communities type games aims simulate control multiple units military setting diﬀerent scales level complexity usually ﬁxed-size duel small teams. goal player collect resources used expand control create buildings units ﬁght enemy deployments ultimately destroy opponents. games exhibit durative moves simultaneous actions often partial observability gameplay components game play economy battles players need gather resources build military units defeat opponents. often worker units gather resources needed build workers buildings military units research upgrades. workers often also builders weak ﬁghts compared military units. resources varying degrees abundance importance. instance starcraft

includes instructions communicate machine learning client interpreted game player mode server starts beginning match shuts ends. in-between matches therefore necessary re-establish connection client
