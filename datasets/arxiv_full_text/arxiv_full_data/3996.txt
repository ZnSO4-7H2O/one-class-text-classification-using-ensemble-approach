{"title": "Face Identification by SIFT-based Complete Graph Topology", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "D.2.2; I.2.10"], "abstract": "This paper presents a new face identification system based on Graph Matching Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for automatic face identification.", "text": "training sample. however illumination
