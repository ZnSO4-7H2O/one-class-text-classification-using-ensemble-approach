{"title": "Tracking Tetrahymena Pyriformis Cells using Decision Trees", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "eess.IV", "q-bio.CB", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Matching cells over time has long been the most difficult step in cell tracking. In this paper, we approach this problem by recasting it as a classification problem. We construct a feature set for each cell, and compute a feature difference vector between a cell in the current frame and a cell in a previous frame. Then we determine whether the two cells represent the same cell over time by training decision trees as our binary classifiers. With the output of decision trees, we are able to formulate an assignment problem for our cell association task and solve it using a modified version of the Hungarian algorithm.", "text": "matching cells time long difﬁcult step cell tracking. paper approach problem recasting classiﬁcation problem. construct feature cell compute feature difference vector cell current frame cell previous frame. determine whether cells represent cell time training decision trees binary classiﬁers. output decision trees able formulate assignment problem cell association task solve using modiﬁed version hungarian algorithm. extract foreground regions cells ﬁrst perform background subtraction frame. number well-known background subtraction algorithms adaptive gaussian mixture models. since background video simple consistent time simply apply median ﬁlter time dimension ﬁrst frames obtain background image. frame subtract background image current frame take absolute value obtain difference image. apply thresholding morphological holes extract connected regions candidate pyriformis cells. region cell segmented extract features cell according shapes graylevel intensities combination both. examples pyriformis cell appearance video shown figure assume cell frame consists pixels coordinates pixel deﬁne useful features cell follows. spatial features cell’s area centroid basic features. another useful spatial feature order normalized inertia measures circularity shape deﬁned researchers creating artiﬁcial magnetotactic tetrahymena pyriformis cells internalization iron oxide nano particles controlling time-varying external magnetic ﬁeld perform multi-cell control task necessary track real-time position cell feedback control system. however problem difﬁcult because pyriformis cells moving fast ﬁeld view;
