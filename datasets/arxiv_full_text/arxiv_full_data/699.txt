International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR 2015. The task comprises the recognition of historical handwritten documents. The core algorithms of our system are based on multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNN) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). The software modules behind that as well as the basic utility technologies are essentially powered by PLANET's ARGUS framework for intelligent text recognition and image processing.", "text":

height writing’s main body part appropriately placed stretched cover essential central part line image. ﬁnally input images subsequent processing recurrent neural networks resulting line images engine’s ﬁrst core component call sequence processing recurrent neural network note processed entire line images segmentation. sprnn’s output consists certain number vectors. number related line
