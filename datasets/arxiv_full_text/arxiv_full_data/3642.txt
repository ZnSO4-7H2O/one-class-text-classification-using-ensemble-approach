{"title": "Conversational flow in Oxford-style debates", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Public debates are a common platform for presenting and juxtaposing diverging views on important issues. In this work we propose a methodology for tracking how ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach in a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner is determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends on aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to make better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively pursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the course of the conversation.", "text": "public debates common platform presenting juxtaposing diverging views important issues. work propose methodology tracking ideas between participants throughout debate. approach case study oxfordstyle debates—a competitive format winner determined audience votes—and show outcome debate depends aspects conversational ﬂow. particular winners tend make better debate’s interactive component losers actively pursuing opponents’ points rather promoting ideas course conversation. public debates common platform presenting juxtaposing diverging viewpoints opposed monologues speakers limited expressing beliefs debates allow participants interactively attack opponents’ points defending own. resulting ideas feature conversation genre. work introduce computational framework characterizing debates terms conversational ﬂow. framework captures main debating strategies—promoting one’s points attacking opponents’ points—and tracks relative usage throughout debate. applying methodology setting debate winners known show conversational patterns predictive debater likely persuade audience. case study oxford-style debates. oxford-style debates provide setting particularly convenient studying effects conversational ﬂow. competitive debate format teams argue preset motion order persuade live audience take position. audience votes debate winning team sways audience towards view. setup allows focus effects conversational since disentangles audience’s prior leaning. debate format involves opening statement sides presents overview arguments discussion begins. allows easily identify talking points held participants prior interaction consider separately points introduced spontaneously serve discussion. work taking steps towards better modeling conversational dynamics introducing debate dataset rich metadata proposing framework tracking ideas showing effectiveness predictive setting study transcripts results oxford-style debates public debate series intelligence squared debates debates recorded live contain motions covering diversity topics ranging foreign policy issues beneﬁts organic food. debate consists opposing teams—one motion against—of three experts topic particular motion along moderator. debate follows oxford-style format consists three rounds. introduction debater given minutes main points. discussion debaters take questions moderator audience respond attacks team. round lasts around minutes highly interactive;
