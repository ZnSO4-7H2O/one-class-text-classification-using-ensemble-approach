{"title": "NeuroNER: an easy-to-use program for named-entity recognition based on  neural networks", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Named-entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying entities of interest in a text. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently been shown to outperform existing NER systems. However, ANNs remain challenging to use for non-expert users. In this paper, we present NeuroNER, an easy-to-use named-entity recognition tool based on ANNs. Users can annotate entities using a graphical web-based user interface (BRAT): the annotations are then used to train an ANN, which in turn predict entities' locations and categories in new texts. NeuroNER makes this annotation-training-prediction flow smooth and accessible to anyone.", "text": "fully supervised approaches include support vector machines maximum entropy models decision trees
