{"title": "A two-stage architecture for stock price forecasting by combining SOM  and fuzzy-SVM", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "68U35", "I.2.3"], "abstract": "This paper proposed a model to predict the stock price based on combining Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and fuzzy-Support Vector Machines (f-SVM). Extraction of fuzzy rules from raw data based on the combining of statistical machine learning models is base of this proposed approach. In the proposed model, SOM is used as a clustering algorithm to partition the whole input space into the several disjoint regions. For each partition, a set of fuzzy rules is extracted based on a f-SVM combining model. Then fuzzy rules sets are used to predict the test data using fuzzy inference algorithms. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with other models using four data sets", "text": "abstract— paper proposed model predict stock price based combining self-organizing fuzzy support vector machines extraction fuzzy rules data based combining statistical machine learning models base proposed approach. proposed model used clustering algorithm partition whole input space several disjoint regions. partition fuzzy rules extracted based f-svm combining model. fuzzy rules sets used predict test data using fuzzy inference algorithms. performance proposed approach compared models using four data sets. nowadays time series forecasting especially predicting stock market attracted interest many scientists. ultimate objective increasing accuracy predicting results many researchers made contributions conducting improving various models solutions. current stock market prediction approached methods either stock price prediction trend stock price past ndays. today application data mining statistical machine learning techniques common approaches used predict stock market movements. many researches proposed applications artificial neutral network support vector machine hidden markov model stock market prediction. order make effective accurate predictions various combined models different forecasting methods researched proposed researchers. model based fuzzy model combined support vector machine trend research called data-driven model whose purpose extract fuzzy rules support vector machine basic functions fuzzy system. challenges data-driven model automatic learning data whose size large representativeness limited. addition avoidance explosion number fuzzy-rules also problem needs solving. k-means som…is approach used divide large sizes data several smaller sizes data main purpose study deal large size data minimize quantity simplify fuzzy rules data;
