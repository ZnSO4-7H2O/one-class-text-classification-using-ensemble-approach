{"title": "User Model-Based Intent-Aware Metrics for Multilingual Search Evaluation", "tag": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "H.1.2; H.5.2"], "abstract": "Despite the growing importance of multilingual aspect of web search, no appropriate offline metrics to evaluate its quality are proposed so far. At the same time, personal language preferences can be regarded as intents of a query. This approach translates the multilingual search problem into a particular task of search diversification. Furthermore, the standard intent-aware approach could be adopted to build a diversified metric for multilingual search on the basis of a classical IR metric such as ERR. The intent-aware approach estimates user satisfaction under a user behavior model. We show however that the underlying user behavior models is not realistic in the multilingual case, and the produced intent-aware metric do not appropriately estimate the user satisfaction. We develop a novel approach to build intent-aware user behavior models, which overcome these limitations and convert to quality metrics that better correlate with standard online metrics of user satisfaction.", "text": "despite growing importance multilingual aspect search appropriate ofﬂine metrics evaluate quality proposed far. time personal language preferences regarded intents query.

best knowledge study devoted evaluation multilingual search means specialized ofﬂine metrics. face task building multilingual metric seem straightforward since great number diversiﬁed search metrics exist however insufﬁciency metrics becomes apparent applies multilingual search. usually case intent-aware approach quality evaluation based relevance assessments documents assigned intent individually. however relevance essentially independent language document meaning document supposed change translation another language. therefore rely relevance labels account language preferences reason state-of-the-art collections like clef contain universal relevance labels therefore faced problem determining per-language relevance probabilities document document’s universal editorial judgment. according traditional intent-aware approach assume relevance probability document whose language coincides intent depends universal judgment only document language coincide language preference document totally irrelevant core principle intent-aware approach diversiﬁed retrieval evaluation could pitfall because variety countries part users speak understand languages though
