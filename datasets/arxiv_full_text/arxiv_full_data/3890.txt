Intelligence data is almost always uncertain and incomplete, making it necessary to reason and taking decisions under uncertainty. One way to manage the uncertainty in Intelligence Analysis is Dempster-Shafer Theory. This thesis contains five results regarding multiple target tracks and intelligence specification.", "text": "johan schubert information system technology division department command control warfare technology national defence research establishment stockholm sweden. e-mail schubertsto.foa.se intelligence analysis vital importance manage uncertainty. intelligence data almost always uncertain incomplete making necessary reason taking decisions uncertainty. manage uncertainty intelligence analysis dempster-shafer theory thesis contains results regarding multiple target tracks intelligence speciﬁcation. objective work develop methods offer decision support anti-submarine warfare intelligence analysts. methods partitions intelligence reports subsets. subset represents possible submarine. able reason simultaneously optimal number submarines uncertain optimal ﬁrst article concerns situation reasoning multiple events handled independently. idea this. receive several pieces evidence different separate events pieces evidence mixed want sort according event referring thus partition pieces evidence subsets subset refers particular event. fig. subsets denoted conﬂict pieces evidence combined dempster’s rule denoted here thirteen pieces evidence partitioned four subsets. number subsets uncertain also domain conﬂict conﬂict current hypothesis number subsets prior belief. uncertain event pieces evidence referring problem. could impossible know directly different pieces evidence referring event. know subset not. solve problem conﬂict dempster’s rule pieces evidence within subset combined indication whether pieces evidence belong together. higher conﬂict less credible belong together. ﬁrst suggested lowrance garvey create additional piece evidence subset proposition adequate partition. proposition take value equal conﬂict combination within subset. call evidence metalevel evidence. article establishes criterion function based metalevel evidence. minimizing function method partitioning evidence subsets. method also handle situation number events uncertain. piece evidence taken subset conﬂict subset decreases. decrease conﬂict interpreted exists pieces metalevel evidence indicating piece evidence took belong subset placed. similarly piece evidence taken subset brought subset conﬂict increase. piece evidence moved receive change number subsets observe change domain conﬂict. changes interpret similar way. subsets approximately equally plausible. without extension plausible subset would take piece evidence certainly belonging subset subsets would never consider reasoning processes. combine pieces evidence. result combination create bpa. previous concerned question subsets support concerned question many subsets supported. fourth article derives special case algorithm making computationally feasible analyze possible tracks target. uncertain whether propositions pieces evidence logical conﬂict model uncertainty additional piece evidence simultaneous belief propositions treat original propositions nonconﬂicting. give rise complete directed acyclic graph original pieces evidence vertices additional ones edges. think vertices positions time space edges transitions positions. proposition piece evidence edge example tell time difference positions small relation distance. algorithm reasons logical conditions completely speciﬁed path graph. hereby gaining signiﬁcantly time space complexity compared step step application dempster’s rule. make decisions uncertainty somecomplicated dempster-shafer theory interval representation. approach decision maker uses additional information subjective views. article strat example. method expected utility interval constructed choice. interval choice included another necessary interpolate discerning point intervals. done parameter ﬁfth article thesis concerned situation several different decision makers might sometimes interested highest expected utility among decision makers rather trying maximize expected utility. individual decision maker must take account choices already done decision makers also rational choices assume made later decision makers. preference alternative decision maker shown length interval alternative highest expected utility.", "year": 2003}
