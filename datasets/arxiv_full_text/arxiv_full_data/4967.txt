{"title": "Setting Players' Behaviors in World of Warcraft through Semi-Supervised  Learning", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Digital games are one of the major and most important fields on the entertainment domain, which also involves cinema and music. Numerous attempts have been done to improve the quality of the games including more realistic artistic production and computer science. Assessing the player's behavior, a task known as player modeling, is currently the need of the hour which leads to possible improvements in terms of: (i) better game interaction experience, (ii) better exploitation of the relationship between players, and (iii) increasing/maintaining the number of players interested in the game. In this paper we model players using the basic four behaviors proposed in \\cite{BartleArtigo}, namely: achiever, explorer, socializer and killer. Our analysis is carried out using data obtained from the game \"World of Warcraft\" over 3 years (2006 $-$ 2009). We employ a semi-supervised learning technique in order to find out characteristics that possibly impact player's behavior.", "text": "abstract—digital games major important ﬁelds entertainment domain

value this turn interactivity game occur automated intelligent computational agents non-playable character shown interaction players game current research areas interest digital games determine style behavior player she/he behaves playing her/his reactions certain types game rules. task known player modeling helps game developers game designers create experiences appeals speciﬁcally devoted behavior. recent research attempts tried expand establish player behaviors although behaviors already established literature however pioneering work introduced approaches create behaviors cited used. bartle identiﬁed four basic behaviors players achievers prefer earn points evolve character acquire equipment concrete measures success game; explorers prefer know whole game environment discover secret areas modeling errors programming errors easter eggs know possible items monsters maps; socializers prefer play online social pleasure interact players naturally evolve character; killers prefer develop character intention obtaining merits achievers. constrast interested competing players enemies powerful complex. figure shows bartle graph four behaviors axles called player-world acting-interacting illustrating interests player behavior achievers world extract resources system/game good; explorers interact world discovering limits using knowledge socializers interact players killers players. figure synthetizes relationship behavior observed bartle reading relationship table made ﬁrst horizontally vertically. example player killer relate well player socializer indicates

revolutionize major digital games world specially increasing number diversity players games bring together thousands players environment easily interact other. several sub-classiﬁcations mmo. particularly mmorpg massively multiplayer online rolling playing game widespread one. case persistent parallel virtual world players represented customizable avatars. game presented work world warcraft shown figure considered played mmorpg world around million active players. released november continuation series warcraft games company blizzard entertainment. since launch game already received several patches expansion including burning crusade wrath lich king game divided factions horde alliance. faction divided races general classes plus zones regions. data collected study comprise horde players. important changes produced patches associated burning crusade increases maximum level added races land called outland maps monsters dungeons cities. addition changes patch allowed horde players access paladin class previously exclusive alliance faction. combat storm also made available. second patch released data gathering process wrath lich king increased maximum level added race land called northrend. study used dataset collected original dataset attributes date/time user guild level race class zone name visited three dummy attributes. data collected days every minutes release cataclysm patch ﬁrst inspected data better understanding then produced information better potential classiﬁcation original data particular interest obtaining useful information assist classiﬁcation four categories associated bartle’s behaviors. thus attributes user race class kept attribute date/time transformed total playing time period analyzed. attribute guild maintained. further added attribute number guilds counts many guilds player joined period analyzed. classifying areas city area regions special behaviors prefer spend time game zone level used information game manual classiﬁed according average level appropriate player. thus divided zones neutral levels beginner medium high. finally original attribute level transformed four attributes initial level final level evolution speed evolution figure summarizes changes made original dataset. since dataset labeled exploited techniques semi-supervised learning. large size dataset labeling process automated data following logical criteria bartle four behaviors presented section used technologies data transformation operations performed python data analysis performed using rapidminer choose rapidminer analysis tool several reasons consolidated package market large installed base users active communities immediate support; acknowledged kdnuggets best tool data mining operators professional analysis purposes; ﬁnally presented tool easy learning curve. dataset used shows players distinct sections play containing data horde. further dataset contain data associated exchange messages players would help identify behaviors bartle. however processed dataset shown figure possible obtain useful information important identify behaviors explained previous section evolution speed evolution others. following observations bartle traced following guidelines behavior taken basis values equation values considered players high values. step adjustment values made three regulars players known authors. time

analysis taken year-basis important every year update patch released changing dynamics game thus enabling analysis impacts changes game player behaviors. figure shows number players belonging races. worth noticing races presented related horde players previously mentioned. clearly popular races orcs undead average preference blood elves tauren preference trolls. preferences classes associated race. instance classes hunters mages warrior preferred ones possibly easier play funny. pre-speciﬁed relationship classes races thus classes available races. observed second graph figure shows preference classes hunters advantages owning unique appeals enough players also quick easy level gain classes. another class fairly chosen natural mage also major damage area facilitates large kill hordes monsters quickly. looking relationship preferences player types proposed bartle note classes preferred great damage easy/rapid evolution effective pvp. third graph shows killers represent players caused great preference rapid since main objective type player socialize gather props pets fashions need continue evolving since habitat neutral cities wild maps. killers usually high-level players actively participate raids camps type player usually attends maps many achievers explorers preferring maps high level survive there places general cities. interesting observation many players changing behavior reach certain characteristics. achiever example become killer explorer reaches highest levels quests become scarce even highest level. therefore possibility explorers killers classes arising achievers. however dataset provide enough information determine type migration behaviors. observed figure relationship behaviors presented bartle evolution players. note term evolution denotes level variation ﬁnal level player minus initial level period data collection. observing graph alone behaviors explorer socializer killer show large discrepancy evolution. analysis contrasting figure figure allows gamers realize stagnating different levels. socializers lower levels killers explorers fail evolve higher levels. analyze achievers note high rates evolution realize evolution ﬁnishes making players level high end. speed evolution given large amount experience quests game also efﬁcient management resources player correct world obtain quick experience. might also analyze data perspective visited number maps order make better separation types players would rather diffuse killer explorer. note data analyzed separation types players. main feature explorer visit many high-class damage. hunters also characteristic explorers. great mobility ﬁeld creatures ease development inferred possibly hunters warriors snap heavily behaviors explorer killer. classes different behaviors well mentioned used socializers achievers depending skill preference player gameplay. observed figure development players behavior. noted striking characteristics behaviors explorers tend medium slow progress note average high therefore walk freely world without killed monsters considered aggressive necessary sufﬁcient annihilate monsters. achievers turn rapid development develop character quests using appropriate maps training. observed achiever usually visit maps killers example fewer maps explorers. note achievers players high rate evolution. socializers usually subdued certain level reach comfortable level items considered fashions offered game stop evolving. obtained condensed dataset shows attributes better information gain ones bartle presented predominant behavior. simplest behavior identify explorers outstanding feature visit many maps quite distinct relation behaviors. furthermore results indicated third graph figure figure clearly show analysis made bartle notable presence killers inhibit presence socializers conjectured. worth mentioning also possible identify game masters game. blizzard employees possess function remain local high concentration players observing behavior regarding compliance rules game example inappropriate words disrupt play others etc. thus users police modern societies. function mute player preventing speak publicly groups also serious cases infringement user game. evolution remaining level many hours connected work presented develop methodology classify players’ behaviors proposed game world warcraft evaluate impact relationship behaviors game. this used dataset collected transformed original dataset useful task proposed. important applications player modeling’s identiﬁcation help game developers game designers create experiences appeals speciﬁcally devoted behavior areas/cities socializers chat play harder enemies killers maps complete/complex explorers advanced class system achievers solutions improve interactivity gameplay players. therefore possible automatically label part original dataset four behaviors proposed bartle killer achiever socializer explorer. result dataset labeled data used technique semi-supervised learning ideal type situation. labeling data followed criteria observed bartle parameter setting done assistance players wow. observed preference certain types classes races behaviors excelled others killers. fact online game several characteristics identiﬁed bartle favor appearance large maps plenty weapons many monsters ﬁght main areas liberated place speciﬁc areas reasons except areas preference explorer game immense maps rich maps possible order know world games accurately well local secret unexplored. killer meanwhile also visit many maps order recognize establish strategies persecution escape enemies players move frequency slightly smaller park observed figure amount maps explorers much higher type player ranked. socializers visit fewer maps since tend park maps en-contros happen safe killers. finally achievers small displacement since focus area order accomplish quests area evolve without major problems. also possible observe something interesting theory shown figure test made tree generation considering attributes base except speed evolution test including speed evolution keeping conﬁguration parameters validation tree. observed left tree much larger included solution attributes initial level final level evolution class race others. however tree right uses attribute condenses several these became smaller. also observed results slightly better accuracy second case realize possible creation attribute condense information various attributes reduces complexity solution improve performance. seen table accuracy achieved proposal work good. credited fact clear difference player behavior proposed bartle always least criterion distinguishes behavior another could confused. figure illustrates result decision tree cases observed tests data collected would sufﬁcient classify players behaviors exploited. suggested bartle important written expression players would assist determining behavior doubt player rankings. technique presented shown quite satisfactory deﬁne behaviors players wow. important note data used allow verify example high level player previously achiever became socializer. analysis would possible monitoring example logs conversations individual player behaviour. thus migration type another included work becomes incentive analysis future work. interesting works expansion include
