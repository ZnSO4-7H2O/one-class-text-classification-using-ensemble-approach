{"title": "Axioms for graph clustering quality functions", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We investigate properties that intuitively ought to be satisfied by graph clustering quality functions, that is, functions that assign a score to a clustering of a graph. Graph clustering, also known as network community detection, is often performed by optimizing such a function. Two axioms tailored for graph clustering quality functions are introduced, and the four axioms introduced in previous work on distance based clustering are reformulated and generalized for the graph setting. We show that modularity, a standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these six properties. This motivates the derivation of a new family of quality functions, adaptive scale modularity, which does satisfy the proposed axioms. Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in the kinds of clusterings that can be found. Standard graph clustering quality functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special cases of adaptive scale modularity.  In general, the results of our investigation indicate that the considered axiomatic framework covers existing `good' quality functions for graph clustering, and can be used to derive an interesting new family of quality functions.", "text": "investigate properties intuitively ought satisﬁed graph clustering quality functions i.e. functions assign score clustering graph. graph clustering also

axiom discuss relation axioms section weights represent stronger connections missing edges weight note opposite convention used distance based clustering. explicitly allow self loops nodes indicates ‘better’ clustering. generalization sometimes work parameterized families quality functions. single quality function seen family parameters. property clustering functions kleinberg example scale invariance clustering function would written graphs optimal clustering invariant scaling edge weights. third form slightly ﬂexible two. quality function satisﬁes property second style also satisfy corresponding property third style converse true. note also restricted property third style take argmaxc obtain clustering function axiom ﬁrst style. kleinberg deﬁned three axioms distance based clustering functions. ackerman ben-david authors reformulated four axioms clustering quality functions. axioms easily adapted graph setting. ﬁrst property expects graph clustering quality clustering depends graph weight edges nodes identity nodes. formalize permutation invariance axiom second property scale invariance requires quality doesn’t change edge weights scaled uniformly. intuitive axiom thinks terms units graph edges scaled graph edges km/h. quality aﬀected transformation perhaps change units. ackerman ben-david deﬁned scale invariance insisting quality contrast puzicha quality stays equal distances scaled. scale proportional scaling distances. generalize previous deﬁnitions considering relations quality clusterings. formulation ﬂexible enough single quality functions. however families quality functions could parameters also scale dependent. families therefore propose axiom ﬂexible property also allows parameters scaled last axiom ackerman ben-david consider interesting. intuitively expect edges within cluster strengthened edges clusters weakened decrease quality. formally call change graph consistent improvement graph setting also becomes natural look combining diﬀerent graphs. distance functions impossible since clear distance nodes diﬀerent sets graphs take edge weight nodes graphs zero case graphs agree neighborhood set. consider adding nodes side large network would want clustering side network change direct connection. example protein discovered yeast clustering unrelated proteins humans remain same. similarly consider graphs disjoint node sets larger graph. quality clusterings original graphs relate directly quality combined graph. general local changes graph local consequences clustering. words contribution single cluster total quality depend nodes neighborhood cluster. quality function preference ﬁxed number clusters local. hand quality function written clusters summand depends properties nodes edges cluster global properties local. ackerman deﬁned similar locality property clustering functions. deﬁnition diﬀers three ways. first looked k-clustering number clusters given ﬁxed. secondly locality property implies consistent clustering rest graph removed corresponding added. finally locality property requires agreement overlapping neighborhood. means clustering functions also give results edges endpoint removed. traag introduced notion resolution-limit-free quality functions similar locality. showed resolution-limit-free quality functions suﬀer resolution limit described fortunato barth´elemy deﬁnition follows. three diﬀerences compared locality property. first deﬁnition property style refers optimal clustering quality i.e. kleinberg. secondly locality require subgraph locality stronger sense. thirdly perhaps importantly subgraph induced edges node nodes removed. means agree common nodes also agree neighborhood. sense locality weaker resolution-limit-freedom. notion resolution-limit-free quality functions born need avoid resolution limit graph clustering. indeed locality enough guarantee quality function free resolution limit. could look stronger version locality replaces agreement neighborhood plain agreement set. strong locality property would imply resolution-limit-freedom. however strong property rules many sensible quality functions. particular strongly local quality function depend weight edges entering leaving cluster weight diﬀerent another graph agrees cluster. solution used traag number nodes instead volume cluster. obtain resolution-limit-free variant potts model reichardt bornholdt call constant potts model. comes cost scale invariance. quality function clearly permutation invariant scale invariant rich local. since consistent change remove edges clusters edges within clusters coco quality function also monotonic. fact kleinberg’s axioms also hold ˆccoco seems refute impossibility result. however impossibility proof directly transfered graphs involves multiplication division maximum distance. graph setting would multiplication division minimum edge weight zero. still despite connected components satisfying previously deﬁned properties useful quality function. many real-world graphs nodes part giant connected component would also like clustering inﬂuenced weight edges existence. natural rule degenerate quality functions require continuity. connected components clustering continuous adding edge small weight clusters changes connected components hence dramatically changes quality. continuous quality functions important property practice provide degree robustness noise. clustering optimal regard continuous quality function still close optimal small change graph. next section show axioms consistent deﬁning quality function family quality functions satisﬁes them. additionally fact quality functions satisfy axioms shows independent. important aspect modularity volume within weight normalized respect total volume graph. ensures quality function scale invariant also means quality change unexpected ways total volume graph changes. leads theorem monotonicity might strong condition. goal clustering single graph actually interested absolute value quality function. rather interest optimal clustering changes graph preserve optimum. smaller scaler look relation clusterings. better graph graphs better problems modularity stem fact total volume change changes made graph. therefore natural look variant modularity total volume replaced constant quality function obviously local. also scale invariant family parameterized however ﬁxed scale modularity quality function scale invariant ﬁxed scale might hope ﬁxed scale modularity would monotonic doesn’t suﬀer problem changes edge weights aﬀect total volume. unfortunately ﬁxed scale modularity problems volume cluster starts exceed adaptive scale modularity quality function clearly still permutation invariant continuous local. also scale invariant. since value scale along edge weights adaptive scale modularity scale invariant family parameterized additionally following theorems shows adaptive scale modularity satisﬁes axioms deﬁned families graph clustering quality functions axioms single quality functions shows extended axioms consistent. contrast quality functions discussed thus uses number nodes instead volume control size clusters. like adaptive scale modularity constant potts model satisﬁes axioms stated before ﬁxed scale adaptive scale modularity quality functions scale invariant family; scale invariant ﬁxed value large problem
