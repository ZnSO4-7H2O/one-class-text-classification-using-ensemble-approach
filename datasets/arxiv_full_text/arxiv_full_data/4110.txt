{"title": "Remote Health Coaching System and Human Motion Data Analysis for  Physical Therapy with Microsoft Kinect", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper summarizes the recent progress we have made for the computer vision technologies in physical therapy with the accessible and affordable devices. We first introduce the remote health coaching system we build with Microsoft Kinect. Since the motion data captured by Kinect is noisy, we investigate the data accuracy of Kinect with respect to the high accuracy motion capture system. We also propose an outlier data removal algorithm based on the data distribution. In order to generate the kinematic parameter from the noisy data captured by Kinect, we propose a kinematic filtering algorithm based on Unscented Kalman Filter and the kinematic model of human skeleton. The proposed algorithm can obtain smooth kinematic parameter with reduced noise compared to the kinematic parameter generated from the raw motion data from Kinect.", "text": "paper summarizes recent progress made computer vision technologies physical therapy accessible affordable devices. ﬁrst introduce remote health coaching system build microsoft kinect. since motion data captured kinect noisy investigate data accuracy kinect respect high accuracy motion capture system. also propose outlier data removal algorithm based data distribution. order generate kinematic parameter noisy data captured kinect propose kinematic ﬁltering algorithm based unscented kalman filter kinematic model human skeleton. proposed algorithm obtain smooth kinematic parameter reduced noise compared kinematic parameter generated motion data kinect. last decade witness increasing interests remote monitoring technologies health care. remote monitoring captures activity anthropometric data subjects. perform online analysis data provide health-care feedback subjects monitored also represent data doctor analysis. typical application physical therapy especially elderly subjects doctors need monitor subjects physical performance home training sessions provide treatments based subjects performance. human performance capture systems widely studied applied many applications. however traditional motion capture systems require particular system setup markers attached subjects monitored make impractical recording motion data home. motion sensors like inertia sensors sensitive noise make also suitable motion capture human daily activities. emerging accessible affordable sensing technologies e.g. depth sensor microsoft kinect make possible capture humans motion data home recently built interactive exercise coaching system based microsoft kinect intended encourage elderly adults perform physical therapy home. since type sensors designed medical purpose acquired motion data usually noisy ﬁdelity motion analysis. example joint position data microsoft kinect usually exhibits signiﬁcant jitters caused depth accuracy occlusions ambiguity loss tracking. body segment lengths also vary motion. order perform online analysis subjects performance feedback subjects studied motion data accuracy microsoft kinect. also studied kinematic parameter extraction motion data captured kinect. paper organized following section introduces interactive system built remote physical therapy;
