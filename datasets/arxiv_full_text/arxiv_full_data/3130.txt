{"title": "An Open Source Pattern Recognition Toolbox for MATLAB", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.MS"], "abstract": "Pattern recognition and machine learning are becoming integral parts of algorithms in a wide range of applications. Different algorithms and approaches for machine learning include different tradeoffs between performance and computation, so during algorithm development it is often necessary to explore a variety of different approaches to a given task. A toolbox with a unified framework across multiple pattern recognition techniques enables algorithm developers the ability to rapidly evaluate different choices prior to deployment. MATLAB is a widely used environment for algorithm development and prototyping, and although several MATLAB toolboxes for pattern recognition are currently available these are either incomplete, expensive, or restrictively licensed. In this work we describe a MATLAB toolbox for pattern recognition and machine learning known as the PRT (Pattern Recognition Toolbox), licensed under the permissive MIT license. The PRT includes many popular techniques for data preprocessing, supervised learning, clustering, regression and feature selection, as well as a methodology for combining these components using a simple, uniform syntax. The resulting algorithms can be evaluated using cross-validation and a variety of scoring metrics to ensure robust performance when the algorithm is deployed. This paper presents an overview of the PRT as well as an example of usage on Fisher's Iris dataset.", "text": "pattern recognition machine learning becoming integral parts algorithms wide range
