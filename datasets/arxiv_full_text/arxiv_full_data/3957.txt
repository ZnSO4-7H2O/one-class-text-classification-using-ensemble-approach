In this manner, using a combining of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), crisp and fuzzy granules are obtained. Balancing of crisp granules and sub- fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation), is rendered in open-close iteration. Using two criteria, \"simplicity of rules \"and \"suitable adaptive threshold error level\", stability of algorithm is guaranteed. In other part of paper, rough set theory (RST), to approximate analysis, has been employed >.Validation of the proposed methods, on the large data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses, in the Shivashan dam, Iran, has been highlighted. By the implementation of the proposed algorithm on the lugeon data set, was proved the suggested method, relating the approximate analysis on the permeability, could be applied.", "text": "abstract paper describes application information granulation theory analysis \"lugeon data\". manner using combining self organizing neuro-fuzzy inference system crisp fuzzy granules obtained. balancing crisp granules subfuzzy granules within fuzzy information rendered open-close iteration. using criteria \"simplicity rules \"and \"suitable adaptive threshold error level\" stability algorithm guaranteed. part paper rough theory approximate analysis employed .validation proposed methods large data in-situ permeability rock masses shivashan iran highlighted. implementation proposed algorithm lugeon data proved suggested method relating approximate analysis permeability could applied. structures design significant issues estimation permeability variations different levels site. however prediction permeability using obtained data in-situ tests challenge. relating determination potential water flow paths within rock mass underlying potential structure especially important extensive several different methods assessing permeability variations rock mass reviewed literature nakaya shahriar owladeghaffari association uncertainty vagueness monitored data particularly resulted in-situ tests accounting relevant approaches probability fuzzy rough theories knowledge acquisition extraction rules prediction unknown cases past distinguished. information granulation theory covers mentioned approaches formats crisp fuzzy main reasons propose theory tackle uncertainty monitored geomechanics data. first human instinct. human being granular view world developed. study using computational intelligence theories namely neural networks fuzzy inference system based theory algorithm analysis permeability data presented applied shivashan site located north western iran. part study investigates application rough theory approximate analysis data comparison results former algorithm. first model self-organizing feature neuro-fuzzy inference system utilized construct igs. determine suitable granulation level criteria \"simplicity rules\" \"adaptive threshold error level\" supposed. information granules collections entities arranged similarity functional adjacency indiscernibility relation. process forming information granules referred many approaches construction example fuzzy c-means rst. granulation level depends requirements project. smaller come detailed processing. hand complex innate feature information real world deal vagueness adopting fuzzy rough analysis combination form necessary. study main develop hierarchical extraction using three main steps -random selection initial crisp granules step close world assumption .but many applications assumption complete information feasible cannot used. cases open world assumption information known agent assumed unknown often accepted fuzzy granulation initial granules fuzzy granules inside precise granules extraction if-then rules. close-open iteration process guideline balancing crisp fuzzy granules random selection initial granules optimal structures increment supporting rules gradually. paper employed main approaches constructing self organizing feature initial granulation nfis secondary granulation. process manner applying rst. self organizing map-neural network kohonen self-organizing networks competition-based network paradigm data clustering. learning procedure kohonen feature maps similar competitive learning networks. main idea behind competitive learning simple;
