{"title": "Real-time face swapping as a tool for understanding infant  self-recognition", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "To study the preference of infants for contingency of movements and familiarity of faces during self-recognition task, we built, as an accurate and instantaneous imitator, a real-time face- swapper for videos. We present a non-constraint face-swapper based on 3D visual tracking that achieves real-time performance through parallel computing. Our imitator system is par- ticularly suited for experiments involving children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder who are often strongly disturbed by the constraints of other methods.", "text": "tion camera. non-constraint real-time system integration existing head posture trackers original face-swapper videos. short delay face swapper reached thanks parallel computing including general-purpose computing graphics processing units novelty work also lies easy calibration. overall system includes head tracker determine head position orientation current subject face swapper replace face subject calibration uses frontal face pictures subjects camera video inputs. devices measuring head’s pose magnetic sensors link mechanisms motion capture unfortunately alter subjects’ behavior natural appearance. non-invasive methods faceapi sparsetemplate-matching-based object tracking camshift solutions exist. however either commercial systems information needed adapt children extend face-swapper could inaccessible lack robustness. matsumoto propose estimation -dof motion face using single camera require heavy set-up personal facial model. lozano otsuka present realstudy preference infants contingency movements familiarity faces during self-recognition task built accurate instantaneous imitator real-time faceswapper videos. human neonates detect contingency movements cannot discriminate image another infant months age. months recognize mirror. months period decisive developmental stage. behavioral studies shown -month-olds display preference familiar faces similar also -month-olds show diﬀerential visual ﬁxation contingent video propose compare contingency movements familiarity faces factors self-recognition experiment imitator reproduces head arms body movements without delay. imitator’s face identical subject’s face look diﬀerent. thus developed face-swapper videos detects face position orientation current subject superimposes image subject face translation coordinates target object txdot tydot velocity along horizontal vertical axes scale rotations along axis rydot velocity rotation along vertical axis global illumination variable. tracker relies multi-processing sparsetemplate-based particle ﬁltering. face model used simpler ellipsoid model. real-time constraint kept thanks parallel processing camera capture head-tracking face-swapping results-display threads. moreover computation particle ﬁlter speeded gpgpu nvidia cuda. system ﬁrst creates automatically replacement faces subject tags position orientation face-swapper thread compares state parameters replacement faces selects closest face replacement superimpose face. render temporal continuity replacement face interpolated superimposition replacement looks dynamic. obtain whole system automatically replacing faces videos renders dynamic movements head. real-time constraint greatest challenge. gpgpu parallel processing decreased delay addition face-swapper robust background distractors faces background head-tracker detect wide range face orientations head pitch angle degrees robust partial occlusion like children bring toys hands mouth faces. system evaluated motion capture system adult subject moving normal speed head rotation ranging pitch angles measured motion capture system show variations. average error presented non-constraint face-swapper based visual tracking achieves real-time performance parallel computing. imitator system particularly suited experiments involving children autistic spectrum disorder often strongly disturbed constraints methods estimate attention point natural social interaction study peculiar attention pattern used imitator evaluate imitation facilitates social behaviors. future improvement focus facial expressions. plan conduct experiment children investigate importance contingency familiarity factors self-recognition. longer perspective results could confronted neuro-scientiﬁc data activation frontal lobe right hemisphere default network model development selfconsciousness context human self-consciousness analysis also implementation robotic sense self-consciousness.", "year": 2011}
