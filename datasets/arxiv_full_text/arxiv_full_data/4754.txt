{"title": "Improving circuit miniaturization and its efficiency using Rough Set  Theory", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "High-speed, accuracy, meticulousness and quick response are notion of the vital necessities for modern digital world. An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power that is wasted in switching of gates, the wiring-crises is reduced, cross-sectional area of chip is reduced, the number of transistors that can implemented in chip is multiplied many folds. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an Artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that make use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.", "text": "sanjiban sekhar anugrah kumar rohit kumar school computing science engineering university sanjibanroygmail.com anugrahgmail.com rrohityahoo.co.in abstracthigh-speed accuracy meticulousness quick response notion vital necessities modern digital world. efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects maneuver whole system. different tools required unravel different types engineering efficiency power consumption electronic circuit always bottle neck problem. need circuit miniaturization always there. saves time power wasted switching gates wiring-crises reduced crosssectional area chip reduced number transistors implemented chip multiplied many folds. therefore trounce problem proposed artificial intelligence based approach make rough theory implementation. theory rough proposed pawlak year rough theory mathematical tool deals uncertainty vagueness. decisions generated using rough theory reducing unwanted superfluous data. condensed number gates without upsetting productivity given circuit. paper proposes approach help rough theory basically lessens number gates circuit based decision rules. object cannot distinguished basis given attributes. hence indiscernibility function attributes consideration indiscernibility relation partitions facts related objects number equivalence classes. equivalence class particular object simply collection indiscernible object often possible attributes attribute values superfluous. enables discard functionally redundant information. rough based approach illustrated follows. different cases represented terms attributes. widely used extracting meaningful information. example data generated gate binary form wires represents attributes. basic idea behind circuit miniaturization mine data obtained result gate logical manner using algebraic developments final result altered. process easily done using rough technique. example shown small circuit technique implemented bigger circuits using procedure. data table circuit shown table table zhang xiong cheng comparative study variable precision rough model graded rough model. international journal approximate reasoning viswanatham rawat shah multicriteria decision examination electrical power grid intelligent systems monitoring system. control international conference ieee. viswanatham krishna saraf gupta mishra applicability rough technique data investigation optimization intrusion detection system. quality reliability security robustness heterogeneous networks springer berlin heidelberg. international conference ieee s.s. gupta sinha ramesh cancer data investigation using variable precision rough proceedings international conference science engineering information technology digital library", "year": 2013}
