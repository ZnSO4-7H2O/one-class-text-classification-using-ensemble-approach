{"title": "Belief Optimization for Binary Networks: A Stable Alternative to Loopy  Belief Propagation", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We present a novel inference algorithm for arbitrary, binary, undirected graphs. Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabilities at each unit,using an analytic expression. Next, we update the marginal probabilities, given the pairwise probabilities by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions as our belief optimization method. However, in cases where belief propagation fails to converge, belief optimization continues to converge to reasonable beliefs. The stable nature of belief optimization makes it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data.", "text": "present novel inference algorithm arbitrary loopy belief propagation point equations bethe free energy. algorithm consists phases first update pairwise given arginal probabili­ probabilities ties unit using analytic expres­ sion. next update marginal proba­ negative gradient bilities bethe free energy. steps guar­ anteed decrease bethe free energy since lower bounded algorithm guaranteed also show bethe free energy equal free energy second order weights. experiments firm belief propagation converges usually finds identical solutions lief optimization belief optimization learning graphical attractive approximately bethe approximation solutions mean field generated since must true pair nodes leads consistency updates. another deriving equations belief propagation passing protocol exact inference trees applying rules graphs cycles named loopy proven successful approximate ticular \"turbo decoding\" equivalent propriate mackay applications image analysis stationary points bethe free seems natural derive algorithm minimizes directly. precisely paper. progress works since allow convenient avoids usual need lagrange multipliers. moreover binary case find analytic expression section tion algorithm. undirected graphical connected weights biases unit observed amount w;jvj bias neighbouring unit interested probability joint probability units following ability binary variables denotes neighbours node however regimes bounds become tight little progress made step alternating procedure consider attractive function insert back free energy update advantage need consider bounds simply make sure reparameterizing gradient based optimization gorithm minimize free energy. notice gradient steps nodes simultaneously instead sequential scent algorithm described before. alternatively point equations show next section equations exactly reduce mean field updates retain terms linear tap-updates retain terms quadratic w;j. therefore updates understood include higher order terms w;i. unfortu­ nately fixed point equations guaranteed converge sometimes need considerable amount damping avoid oscillations. algebra claim follows levin results). gies equal second order weights fixed point equations equal second order respective tives respect show correlations equal first order weights. terms linear weights retained mean field free energy. since function terms contribute pansion fbethe form right). size biases vary values vertical direction arrows indicate updates convergence. notice bias mean scales weights biases varied range figures show errors estimated means covariances evident methods become inaccurate weights large biases small. limit strong correlations modelled adequately assume independence weights bethe approximation assumes within correlatio detailed show instances situated difficult regime mentioned above. right plot figure shows differ­ bottom left right figures show scatterplots means covariances respectively. although points populate diagonal plots provide interesting spond difficult cases. usually free energies never differ converged cases seems done slightly better locating minimum even non-convergent cases differences relatively small. figure shows results lattice situation ization constrai random variables case probabilities ergy barriers surface imagine however effectively search needed find whether tion methods applied techniques discussed plied gaussian appendix portant sarily matrix come surprise global performs putations. always bounded exactly converge. cabo find answer experimentally. certain proved biases evidence). reason could energy surface cause lack convergence gence local minima however hard find whether breaks down. least three regimes bethe approximation accurate small weights significant contribute larger therefore imation. cycles around loops double counted consequence. weights formation dies addition dencies double counting effect increase bethe approximation. used simple gradient rithm solve note since entropy term free energy approximate independent since covariances decoupled means energy mediately free taking derivatives rithm used solve found update equations give exactly solution gaussian fixed point iterations derived surprisingly ways converge ergy always bounded become arbitrary conditions this. problem gabp gabo cannot impose positive covariance constraint tations. emperical studies found gabp gabo either converge answer fail converge. leads conjecture following", "year": 2013}
