An essential first step in understanding these sources is the ability to identify the part of speech in each sentence. Arabic is a morphologically rich language, wich presents a challenge for part of speech tagging. In this paper, our goal is to propose, improve and implement a part of speech tagger based on a genetic alorithm. The accuracy obtained with this method is comparable to that of other probabilistic approaches.", "text": "growing number textual resources available ability understand becomes critical. essential ﬁrst step understanding sources ability identify parts-of-speech sentence. arabic morphologically rich language presents challenge part speech tagging. paper goal propose improve implement part-of-speech tagger based genetic algorithm. accuracy obtained method comparable probabilistic approaches. arabic garnering attention natural language processing community socio-political importance linguistic differences indo-european languages. linguistic characteristics especially dialect differences complex morphology present interesting challenges researchers. part-of-speech tagging also known pos-tagging word classes morphological classes lexical tags tagging basic tools components necessary robust natural language processing infrastructure given language. examples partsof-speech noun verb pronoun preposition adverb adjective tags. analyzing syntactic structure sentences text necessary group words classes categories. part-of-speech tagging linguistic procedure attaches word category information words text. result part-of-speech tagging maybe interesting many applications language technology information useful. example post considered basic tools needed speech recognition natural language parsing information retrieval information extraction question answering speech recognition text-tospeech conversion machine translation grammar correction many more. also main tools needed develop language corpus. genetic algorithm probabilistic search method based principles natural selection. stochastic search method successfully applied many real applications high complexity. iterative technique applies stochastic operators pool individuals evaluation function associates value every individual indicating suitability problem. efficiently used solution combinatorial optimization problems. sense quite successful many natural language applications many languages construct arabic part-of-speech tagger genetic approach assigns tags input text. remainder paper organized follows next section allocated present survey current approaches part speech taggers. section explain beneﬁts genetic algorithms. section develop genetic approach arabic part-of-speech tagging problem. last section present discuss numerical results. system based ﬁnding correcting errors. training period manually tagged training corpus system recognizes weaknesses corrects constructing rule base types rules used tagger eric brill statistical approach came existence gained popularity approach requires much less human effort successful model last years hidden markov models related techniques focused building probabilistic models transition sequences sentence. results produced statistical taggers giving correctly tagged words. however statistical part speech taggers several potential drawbacks inﬂexible tagging process small amount information combination statistical rule-based methods also used develop hybrid taggers seem produce higher rate accuracy. accuracy reported tapanainen voultilainen transformation-based learning often also called brill tagging introduced eric brill achieved accuracy corpus outperforming tagger. learning algorithm starts building lexicon combines beneﬁts rule-based probabilistic parts-of-speech tagging. usually tagger ﬁrst assigns every word likely part-of-speech. introduce several errors. next step correct many errors possible applying transformation rules tagger learned. memory-based learning simple learning method examples massively retained memory. similarity memory examples examples used predict outcome example. contains components search optimal solution heuristic nature;
