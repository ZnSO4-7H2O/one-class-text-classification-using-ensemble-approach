{"title": "Virtual PET Images from CT Data Using Deep Convolutional Networks:  Initial Results", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "In this work we present a novel system for PET estimation using CT scans. We explore the use of fully convolutional networks (FCN) and conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) to export PET data from CT data. Our dataset includes 25 pairs of PET and CT scans where 17 were used for training and 8 for testing. The system was tested for detection of malignant tumors in the liver region. Initial results look promising showing high detection performance with a TPR of 92.3% and FPR of 0.25 per case. Future work entails expansion of the current system to the entire body using a much larger dataset. Such a system can be used for tumor detection and drug treatment evaluation in a CT-only environment instead of the expansive and radioactive PET-CT scan.", "text": "abstract. work present novel system estimation using scans. explore fully convolutional networks conditional generative adversarial networks export data data. dataset includes pairs scans used training testing. system tested detection malignant tumors liver region. initial results look promising showing high detection performance case. future work entails expansion current system entire body using much larger dataset. system used tumor detection drug treatment evaluation ct-only environment instead expansive radioactive pet-ct scan. combination positron emission tomography computerized tomography scanners become standard component diagnosis staging oncology increased accumulation fluoro-d-glucose used relative normal tissue useful marker many cancers help detection localization malignant tumors additionally pet/ct imaging becoming important evaluation tool drug therapies although imaging many advantages disadvantages make diﬃcult treatment receive. radioactive component risk pregnant breast feeding patients. moreover relatively medical procedure expensive. hence still oﬀered majority medical centers world. diﬃculty providing imaging part treatment raises need alternative less expensive fast easy pet-like imaging. work explore virtual module uses information data estimate pet-like images emphasis malignant lesions. achieve virtual recent years deep learning become dominant research topic numerous ﬁelds. speciﬁcally convolutional neural networks used many challenges computer vision. obtained outstanding performance diﬀerent tasks visual object recognition image classiﬁcation handwritten character recognition more. deep cnns introduced lecun supervised learning model formed multi-layer neural networks. cnns fully data-driven retrieve hierarchical features automatically building high-level features low-level ones thus obviating need manually customize hand-crafted features. previous works shown beneﬁt using fully convolutional architecture liver lesion detection segmentation applications fully convolutional networks take input arbitrary size produce correspondingly-sized output eﬃcient inference learning. unlike patch based methods loss function using architecture computed entire image. network processes entire images instead patches removes need select representative patches eliminates redundant calculations patches overlap therefore scales eﬃciently image resolution. moreover fusion diﬀerent scales adding links combine ﬁnal prediction layer lower layers ﬁner strides. recent works show generative adversarial networks image image translation gans generative models learn mapping random noise vector output image contrast conditional gans learn mapping observed image random noise vector generator trained produce outputs cannot distinguished real images adversarially trained discriminator trained best possible detect generators fakes. fig. shows diagram procedure. study explore conditional estimating pet-like images volumes. advantages method used create realistic looking virtual images speciﬁc attention hepatic malignant tumors. best knowledge ﬁrst work explores translation using deep learning. predicts virtual image output;
