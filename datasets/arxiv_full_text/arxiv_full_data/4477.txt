The reason of this inadequacy is due to the high degree of complexity of the mechanisms that govern these systems. It is proposed in this paper to shift the attention from modeling the engineering system itself to modeling the uncertainty that underlies its behavior. A mathematical framework for modeling the uncertainty in complex engineering systems is developed. This framework uses the results of computational learning theory. It is based on the premise that a system model is a learning machine.", "text": "existing procedures model validation deemed inadequate many engineering systems. reason inadequacy high degree

foregoing model validation procedure criticized many areas engineering. wastewater engineering example jeppsson pointed that strict sense model validation impossible existing validation techniques. similarly zheng bennett noted that groundwater engineering models like scientiﬁc hypothesis cannot validated absolute sense invalidated. konikow bredehoeft suggested terms like model veriﬁcation model
