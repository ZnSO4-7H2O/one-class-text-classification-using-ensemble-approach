{"title": "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in  Medical Abstracts", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We present PubMed 200k RCT, a new dataset based on PubMed for sequential sentence classification. The dataset consists of approximately 200,000 abstracts of randomized controlled trials, totaling 2.3 million sentences. Each sentence of each abstract is labeled with their role in the abstract using one of the following classes: background, objective, method, result, or conclusion. The purpose of releasing this dataset is twofold. First, the majority of datasets for sequential short-text classification (i.e., classification of short texts that appear in sequences) are small: we hope that releasing a new large dataset will help develop more accurate algorithms for this task. Second, from an application perspective, researchers need better tools to efficiently skim through the literature. Automatically classifying each sentence in an abstract would help researchers read abstracts more efficiently, especially in fields where abstracts may be long, such as the medical field.", "text":

particularly randomized controlled trials commonly considered best source medical evidence since sentences abstract appear sequence call task sequential sentence classiﬁcation task order distinguish general text sentence classiﬁcation context. number rcts published every year steadily increasing figure illustrates. million rcts published around half pubmed makes challenging medical investigators pinpoint information looking for. researchers search previous literature e.g. write systematic reviews often skim abstracts order quickly check whether papers match criteria interest. process easier abstracts structured i.e. text abstract divided semantic headings objective method result conclusion. however half published abstracts unstructured shown figure makes difﬁcult quickly access
