{"title": "Injury risk prediction for traffic accidents in Porto Alegre/RS, Brazil", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This study describes the experimental application of Machine Learning techniques to build prediction models that can assess the injury risk associated with traffic accidents. This work uses an freely available data set of traffic accident records that took place in the city of Porto Alegre/RS (Brazil) during the year of 2013. This study also provides an analysis of the most important attributes of a traffic accident that could produce an outcome of injury to the people involved in the accident.", "text": "abstract—this study describes experimental application machine learning techniques build prediction models assess injury risk associated trafﬁc accidents. work uses freely available data trafﬁc accident records took place city porto alegre/rs year study also provides analysis important attributes trafﬁc accident could produce outcome injury people involved accident. statistics provided eptc trafﬁc managing agency porto alegre/rs shows approximately trafﬁc accidents took place city porto alegre average trafﬁc accidents month. according saunier social cost road collisions largest side effect road transportation costs fatalities injuries property damage well medical care trafﬁc delays accounts signiﬁcant impact ﬁnance people involved cities government. according brazilian national trafﬁc department average cost accident without victims accidents victims cost increases accidents fatalities cost descriptive analysis situation road safety road accidents important understanding factors related dangerous situations patterns data even greater importance able predict trafﬁc accident result injury help trafﬁc agencies provide faster medical care. another example beneﬁts understanding factors behind injury risk guide trafﬁc agencies improve road safety means infrastructure design even pedestrian/driver behavior improvements could obtained targeted marketing campaigns. data-driven decisions also help trafﬁc agencies reduce costs involved trafﬁc accident. paper describes efforts experimental results obtained application machine learning techniques order provide better
