In this work we define a P system based artificial graph chemistry to understand the principles leading to the evolution of life-like structures in an AC set up and to develop a unified framework to characterize and classify symbolic artificial chemistries by devising appropriate formalism to capture semantic and organizational information. An extension of P system is considered by associating probabilities with the rules providing the topological framework for the evolution of a labeled undirected graph based molecular reaction

artiﬁcial chemistries. start discussion epistemological foundations area illustrate details using examples relevant proposal. examples followed discussions motivate main theme proposal elaborated coming sections. long held topic scientiﬁc debate whether biological principles life complex biological phenomena directly reducible physical chemical laws. living beings however small consisting molecular components living things nonetheless exhibit qualitatively diﬀerent characteristics. part complex organizational structure distinguishes could quantitatively complex structure gives rise diﬃculty analyzing properties using currently available tools. direct ways understand complex biological phenomena usually diﬃcult error prone living structures default complex hard manipulate. even cellular level experiments diﬃcult carry simulations quite cumbersome. artiﬁcial life tool study principles explaining complex phenomena life without directly getting involved real biological systems. fundamental assumption principles life independent medium carbon based life earth example possible forms life. means even artiﬁcial environments like digital media also exhibit life-like behavior certain conditions. complements main stream biological studies synthesizing life-like systems using digital media. several examples artiﬁcial life forms exhibit properties remarkably close higher

relative quantitative dynamics various molecules captured terms diﬀerential equations. replicator equations lotka-volterra type used describe relative concentration self replicating molecules. discussion actual chemistry especially case organic compounds chains carbon atoms possible branching chemical reactions substitute parts molecule molecule thus leading structural rearrangement chemical composition molecules. main motivation behind choice lambda terms alchemy substitution abstracted function composition lambda terms. second motivation many chemical reactions give rise chemical compound captured normal form equivalence. alchemy also constructive chemistry like real chemistry. also notion equality leads formation network molecules. stochastic collision dynamics choice reaction type alchemy gives rise interesting forms organizations classiﬁed level- level- level- organizations. level- organization consists self replicating molecules whose frequencies modelled using replicator equations level- organization strong element self-maintenance reaction molecules produces molecule inside population. level- organization coexistence interdependent level- organizations support other. though alchemy captures certain basic aspects real chemical compounds reactions limitations. important related choice lambda calculus. even though lambda calculus computationally universal consistent reduction strategy serious bearing chemical counter part. actual chemical reactions much complex might follow computationally consistent mechanisms like total

products. hand case substitution lambda terms conditions apply instances free variable equally substituted everywhere. propose alternate structure reaction rules overcome limitation next section. second limitation poor abstraction structural properties chemical compounds. kind compounds might resembling lambda terms structurally long carbon chains possible branching. double helix structure complementarity diﬃcult capture using lambda terms. geometrical properties like chirality common living forms well cannot captured using lambda terms. signiﬁcance lack structural abstraction geometrical properties clear. since chemical reactions driven thermodynamic constraints like rate collision pressure properties colliding molecules usually symmetrical nature. thus result collision
