{"title": "A Methodology for Player Modeling based on Machine Learning", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "AI is gradually receiving more attention as a fundamental feature to increase the immersion in digital games. Among the several AI approaches, player modeling is becoming an important one. The main idea is to understand and model the player characteristics and behaviors in order to develop a better AI. In this work, we discuss several aspects of this new field. We proposed a taxonomy to organize the area, discussing several facets of this topic, ranging from implementation decisions up to what a model attempts to describe. We then classify, in our taxonomy, some of the most important works in this field. We also presented a generic approach to deal with player modeling using ML, and we instantiated this approach to model players' preferences in the game Civilization IV. The instantiation of this approach has several steps. We first discuss a generic representation, regardless of what is being modeled, and evaluate it performing experiments with the strategy game Civilization IV. Continuing the instantiation of the proposed approach we evaluated the applicability of using game score information to distinguish different preferences. We presented a characterization of virtual agents in the game, comparing their behavior with their stated preferences. Once we have characterized these agents, we were able to observe that different preferences generate different behaviors, measured by several game indicators. We then tackled the preference modeling problem as a binary classification task, with a supervised learning approach. We compared four different methods, based on different paradigms (SVM, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes and JRip), evaluating them on a set of matches played by different virtual agents. We conclude our work using the learned models to infer human players' preferences. Using some of the evaluated classifiers we obtained accuracies over 60% for most of the inferred preferences.", "text": "dissertação apresentada programa pós-graduação ciência computação instituto

since able characterize goldrate growth able gold indicator. believe difﬁculty describe preference fact gold most common important resources game permeating several possibilities degenerates gold evolution time. last preference analyzed harder characterized partially able model since goldrate describe gold. reasons easy comprehended analysis results creating city implies great loss gold since cost cities greater income. thus variation observed explained this. great jump turn explained discovery mercantilism besides fact cities became proﬁtable. summary unable distinguish different agents

revisited every generated model recreating different subsets i.e. previous model generates others using data victories defeats. intuition game result would impact indicators. present analysis below. regarding culture another analysis preference useful validate results previously obtained since extremely satisfactorily. again modeled culture polynomial degree culturerate polynomial degree four lost matches. previous modeling regressions good sets obtained coefﬁcients zero conﬁdence model growth followed previous methodology dividing indicators periods expansionist maintenance. preference able observe beneﬁts separation matches lost. beneﬁt decrease data variability better understanding problem. able obtain distinguishable model different agents. ﬁrst evaluated indicator cities. general evaluation expansionist period easily characterized hatshepsut alexander victory defeat conﬁdence coefﬁcients zero. interesting note that subset matches coefﬁcients overlap matches lost. non-independent coefﬁcient alexander greater hatshepsut conﬁdence besides this hatshepsut presents more expansionist behavior increases victory chances. believe statistical difference achieved lost

game result inﬂuence indicators since observed higher variability lost matches probably different types victory agent lose game score lands devastated enemy. coefﬁcients determination alexander hatshepsut situation were respectively difference probably explained military preference ﬁrst evaluated here. probably better able defend lands even loses game. figure presents number cities lost

generated game result precisely number cities. observed variability large matches speciﬁc turn cities continue increasing start decreasing. analysis land indicator victory defeat similar general analysis. able characterize well expansionist period able distinguish coefﬁcients agents even matches lost. able show regression growth rate alexander greater hatshepsut’s growth rate also conﬁdence results lost matches extremely variable discussion comparing meaningless. despite variability decrease matches subset able obtain additional useful information separation. last indicator related preference needs revisited plots. division keeps excellent characterization expansionist period victory defeat subsets still unable distinguish different agents. data variability decreased division additional discussion analysis possible. finally regarding gold ﬁrstly analyzing victory subset able obtain good regressions goldrate indicator equals louis coefﬁcients different zero conﬁdence also achieved mansa musa conﬁdence coefﬁcients different zero. similarly general characterization coefﬁcients regressions overlap. happened lost matches subset. able obtain coefﬁcients different zero conﬁdence regressions equals alexander mansa musa. figure presents regression last case. analysis defeat situations shows higher variability observed general data mansa musa explained matches lost. probably occurs loses cities game implies smaller gold rate. modeled gold scores single lines. mansa musa’s gold indicator matches lost could characterized distinct lines decided keep regression similar others indicator seen figure graphs observe high variability indicator values previously discussed probably cities feature. matches subset observed louis xiv’s non-independent coefﬁcient greater mansa musa’s coefﬁcient preference gold. relation inverted subset matches lost. interesting note results seem counter intuitive since would expect higher coefﬁcient cases. happen louis high preference culture inﬂuences amount gold since culture generates territorial expansion implies higher number resources. summary analyses achieve different conclusions ﬁrst analyzed data separation matches lost generally implied getting better half models worse half. despite able better characterize separated models able distinguish agents preferences already distinguished general data. whether division beneﬁcial trivial decision. depends chosen technique since fusion victory defeat make implicit average performance agent tends lose time would able better characterize losing performance since natural weights would raise automatically results accumulation. would difﬁcult considering separated matches. regarding generic representation proposed previous chapter section instantiate game

players’ preferences aiming off-line review; could also assist discussing regarding impact match results classiﬁcation. finally related main topic work automatic classiﬁcation player’s preferences several tasks performed. regarding evaluation features want perform different data analyses could assist task selecting appropriate features classiﬁers. interesting approaches evaluate impact using ﬁrst turns preference classiﬁcation apply feature selection methods dataset maybe trying consider indicators’ semantics. already discussed believe absence ﬁrst turns determinant poor accuracy obtained classifying growth preference. feature selection problem hard topic since discussed feature meaningless associated others useful. fact several possibilities evaluate topic know works presented concerns automatically selecting smaller representative features modeling players. additionally results improved application over/undersampling techniques dataset could deal unbalanced classes. another topic discuss also worth investigation applicability whole ﬁeld evaluation correctness players’ self labeled preferences. last possible future work ambitious technique considers turn intermediate state player. instead classifying player turn algorithm would understand turn stream would classify player given number turns. turns would responsible increasing algorithm conﬁdence player speciﬁc preference. work used approach bard bowling used particle ﬁltering model poker players. however approach much simpler would required here. summary made several contributions ﬁeld taxonomy evaluation generic representation study appropriate features model players well evaluation several different classiﬁers discussing possible industry. fact believe thesis highlighted speciﬁc need better evaluating decisions generally made without much care selection features classiﬁers. consider player modeling still open topic deserves lots investigation. molineaux ponsen learning
