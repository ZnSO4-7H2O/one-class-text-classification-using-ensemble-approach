{"title": "Deep Learning for Identifying Potential Conceptual Shifts for  Co-creative Drawing", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We present a system for identifying conceptual shifts between visual categories, which will form the basis for a co-creative drawing system to help users draw more creative sketches. The system recognizes human sketches and matches them to structurally similar sketches from categories to which they do not belong. This would allow a co-creative drawing system to produce an ambiguous sketch that blends features from both categories.", "text": "present system identifying conceptual shifts visual categories form basis co-creative drawing system help users draw creative sketches. system recognizes human sketches matches structurally similar sketches categories belong. would allow co-creative drawing system produce ambiguous sketch blends features categories. creative sketching important wide variety domains including engineering architecture propose co-creative system plays free association drawing game facilitates creative sketches introducing conceptual shifts. co-creative systems user collaborate creative task proposed agent recognizes objects human sketches responds suggesting conceptual shift. context conceptual shift entails recognizing object different conceptual category current object shares structural characteristics. goal respond another sketch leverages conceptual shift drawing conceptual blend objects. resulting free association game would encourage ﬂuent expression ideas user. system described forms basis co-creative tool helps user learn creative sketching. clustering deep features train co-creative agent generate visual representation sketches enable conceptual shift. training steps learning visual representation sketches. deep learning architectures able extract highly detailed visual representations images leading high classiﬁcation accuracy highquality generated images google quick draw dataset place user input train system subset categories images each. represent sketch high-level feature vector obtained using vgg- standard convolutional neural network architecture. started model pre-trained imagenet dataset ﬁne-tuned weights training sketches. model contains convolutional clustering sketches sets. objects category high variance separate category using clustering vgg- representation identiﬁes structurally similar sub-categories identifying potential conceptual shifts. fact humans different perceptions drawing stereotypical shape object leads highly different images despite belonging category. used k-means algorithm selected elbow method. proposed co-creative drawing system user agent take turns sketch. agent perceive user input identify opportunities conceptual shifts. identify potential conceptual shifts match objects category structurally similar objects another category. compare euclidean distances centroids cluster sketch belongs clusters categories. identify cluster minimum distance current object’s cluster propose conceptual shift. approach involves steps recognizing. agent takes user’s sketch extracts feature vector determines cluster. matching. user’s sketch matched similar cluster isn’t object category current sketch. contributing. agent contributes sketch cluster identiﬁed potential conceptual shift. demonstrate utility algorithms provide case study exploring system could respond users’ sketches. case study explores different ways system could respond input sketch. call response conceptual shifts. scenario user’s sketch matched sketch another category. algorithm determines category structurally similar user’s input generates response based calculation. figure figure show resulting proposed conceptual shifts input categories each. euclidean distance used determine category closest input sketch. figure shows input-response pairs similar figure shows closest match less similar single input multiple responses conceptual shifts. second scenario case study user draws input item system generates many potential conceptual shifts different categories. user began sketching object. system extracted visual features object matched potential conceptual shifts. multiple inputs multiple responses conceptual shifts. ﬁnal scenario shown figure figure user produces multiple iterations object category. system selects different conceptual shift category input. case user drew several types object unique structural characteristics. algorithm ﬁnds different potential conceptual shifts case. paper described co-creative drawing system plays free association game. described framework identiﬁes conceptual shift recognizing matching contributing. system used basis drawing agent creates conceptual blends encourage user creativity. future investigate alternative architectures encoder improve sketch representation clustering. addition would like develop comprehensive matching algorithm conceptual shifts incorporate neural approach drawing.", "year": 2018}
