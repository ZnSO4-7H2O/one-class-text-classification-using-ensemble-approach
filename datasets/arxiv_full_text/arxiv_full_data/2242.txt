{"title": "Is Epicurus the father of Reinforcement Learning?", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "The Epicurean Philosophy is commonly thought as simplistic and hedonistic. Here I discuss how this is a misconception and explore its link to Reinforcement Learning. Based on the letters of Epicurus, I construct an objective function for hedonism which turns out to be equivalent of the Reinforcement Learning objective function when omitting the discount factor. I then discuss how Plato and Aristotle 's views that can be also loosely linked to Reinforcement Learning, as well as their weaknesses in relationship to it. Finally, I emphasise the close affinity of the Epicurean views and the Bellman equation.", "text": "democritus complementing ideas aristotle vigorously criticised. views popular athens aristotelian philosophers dominated epicurus moved lesbos. however philosophy accepted;
