As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.", "text": "abstract—geosciences ﬁeld great societal relevance requires solutions several urgent problems facing

components geoscience processes generally obtained broad categories data sources observational data collected sensors space land simulation data physics-based models earth system. brieﬂy describe categories gesocience data sources following. detailed review earth science data sets properties found geoscience observations information earth system collected different acquisition methods varying scales space time variety geoscience objectives. example nexus earth observing satellites space tasked monitor number geoscience variables surface temperature humidity optical reﬂectance chemical

companies spacex together contributing huge volume variety remote sensing data earth many publicly available remote sensing data provides global picture history geoscience variables spatial scales regular time intervals long periods sometimes starting targeted studies speciﬁc geographic regions interest geoscience observations also collected using sensors on-board ﬂying devices unmanned aerial vehicles airplanes e.g. detect classify sources methane emitted atmosphere another major source geoscience observations collection in-situ sensors placed ground moving atmosphere ocean sensorbased observations geoscience processes generally available non-uniform grids space irregular intervals time sometimes even moving bodies balloons ships buoys. constitute reliable direct sources information earth’s weather climate systems actively maintained public agencies national oceanic atmospheric administration sensor-based measurements rain river gauges also central understanding hydrological processes surface water discharge land-based seismic sensors global positioning system -enabled devices geophysical instruments also continuously measure earth’s geological structure processes addition also proxy measurements paleoclimatic records sparsely available select locations back several thousands years. given huge variety characteristics data different geoscience processes important identify type properties given geoscience data make utmost relevant data analytics methodologies. example remote sensing data sets commonly available rasters regularly-spaced grid cells space time represented geo-registered images individual time points time series data individual spatial locations. hand sensor measurements ships ocean buoys represented point reference data continous spatio-temporal ﬁelds. indeed possible convert data type another across different spatial temporal resolutions using simple interpolation methods advanced methods based physical understanding reanalysis techniques system deeply grounded physical laws principles discovered scientiﬁc community multiple centuries systematic research. example motion water lithosphere atmosphere governed principles ﬂuid dynamics navier– stokes equation. although physics-based equations sometimes solved closed form small-scale experiments often difﬁcult obtain exact solutions complex real-world systems encountered geosceiences. however underlying physical principles still used simulate evolution states earth system using numerical models referred physicsbased models. models standard workhorse studying majority geoscience processes state dynamical system time-stepped back past forward future using inputs initial boundary conditions values internal parameters physical equations. physics-based models generate large volumes simulation data different components earth system used data-driven analyses. developed maintained number centers constituting diverse groups researchers

characteristics geoscience applications limit usefulness traditional machine learning algorithms knowledge discovery. firstly inherent challenges arising nature geoscience processes. example geoscience objects generally amorphous boundaries space time crisply deﬁned objects domains users social networking website products retail store. geoscience phenomena also spatio-temporal structure highly multi-variate follow non-linear relationships show non-stationary characteristics often involve rare interesting events. secondly apart inherent challenges geoscience processes procedures used collecting geoscience observations introduce challenges machine learning. includes presence data multiple resolutions space time varying degrees noise incompleteness uncertainties. thirdly supervised learning approaches additional challenges small sample size lack gold-standard ground truth geoscience applications. following describe three categories geoscience challenges namely inherent challenges geoscience processes geoscience data collection challenges paucity samples ground truth detail. property objects amorphous boundaries geoscience objects include waves ﬂows coherent structures phases matter. hence form structure patterns geoscience objects exist multiple scales continuous spatio-temporal ﬁelds much complex found discrete spaces machine learning algorithms typically deal with items market basket data. example eddies storms hurricanes dynamically deform complicated ways purely object-oriented perspective. techniques consider pattern dynamical information coherent objects uncertainties developed methods capturing features geoscience objects e.g. ﬂuid segmentation ﬂuid feature characterization needed. property spatiotemporal structure since almost every geoscience phenomena occurs realm space time geoscience observations generally auto-correlated space time observed appropriate spatial temporal resolutions. example location covered certain land cover label generally surrounded locations similar land cover labels. land cover labels also consistent along time i.e. label certain time related labels immediate temporal vicinity. furthermore land cover certain location changes change generally persists temporal duration instead switching back forth. autocorrelation dictates stronger connectivity among nearby observations space time geoscience processes also show long-range spatial dependencies. example commonly studied phenomenon climate science teleconnections distant regions world show strongly coupled activity climate variables temperature pressure. geoscience processes also show long-memory characteristics time e.g. effect climate indices southern oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation global ﬂoods droughts forest ﬁres inherent spatio-temporal structure geoscience data several implications machine learning methods. many widely used machine learning methods founded assumption observed variables independent identically distributed however assumption routinely violated geoscience problems variables structurally related context space time unless discontinuity fault across autocorrelation ceases persist. cognizance spatio-temporal autocorrelation geoscience data collected continuous media crucial effective modeling geophysical phenomena. multaneously example robust complete detection land cover changes forest ﬁres requires analysis multiple remote sensing variables vegetation indices thermal anomaly signals. capturing effects multiple variables resolutions space time renders geoscience data inherently high dimensional number dimensions easily reach orders millions. example order study processes occurring earth’s surface even relatively coarse resolution data easily result spatial grid points every grid point multiple observations time. furthermore geoscience phenomena limited earth’s surface extend beneath earth’s surface across multiple layers atmosphere mantle additionally increasing dimensionality data spatial resolutions. hence need scale existing machine learning methods handle tens thousands millions dimensions global analysis geoscience phenomena. property heterogeneity space time interesting characteristic geoscience processes degree variability space time leading rich heterogeneity geoscience data across space time. example presence varying geographies vegetation types rock formations climatic conditions different regions earth characteristics geoscience variables vary signiﬁcantly location other. furthermore earth system stationary time goes many cycles ranging seasonal decadal cycles long-term geological changes even climate change phenomena impact local processes. heterogeneity geoscience processes makes difﬁcult study joint distribution geoscience variables across points space time. hence difﬁcult train machine learning models good performance across regions space across time-steps. instead need build local regional models corresponding homogeneous group observations. property interest rare phenomena number geoscience problems interested studying objects processes events occur infrequently space time major impacts society earth’s ecosystem. example extreme weather events cyclones ﬂash ﬂoods heat waves result huge losses human life property thus making vital monitor adaptation mitigation requirements. processes relate emergent states earth system features complex systems anomalous state trajectories basins attractions another example detecting rare changes earth’s biosphere deforestation insect damage forest ﬁres helpful assessing impact human actions informing decisions promote ecosystem sustainability. identifying rare classes changes events geoscience data characterizing behavior challenging. geoscience data collection challenges property multi-resolution data geoscience data sets often available different sources varying spatial temporal resolutions. data sets exhibit varying characteristics sampling rate accuracy uncertainty. example in-situ sensors buoys ocean hydrological weather measuring stations often irregularly spaced. another example collecting highresolution data ecosystem processes forest ﬁres require using aerial imageries planes ﬂying region interest need combined coarser resolution satellite imageries available frequent time intervals. analysis multi-resolution geoscience data sets help characterize processes occur varying scales space time. example processes plate tectonics gravity occur global scale local processes include volcanism earthquakes landslides. handle multi-resolution data common approach build bridge data sets disparate scales represented resolution. also need develop algorithms identify patterns multiple resolutions without upsampling data sets highest resolution. property noise incompleteness uncertainty data many geoscience data sets plagued noise missing values. example sensors temporarily fail malfunctions severe weather conditions resulting missing data. additionally changes measuring equipment e.g. replacing faulty sensor switching satellite generation next change interpretation sensor values time making difﬁcult deploy consistent methodology analysis across different time periods. many geoscience applications signal interest small magnitude compared magnitude noise. furthermore many sensor properties increase noise sensor interference e.g. case remotely sensed land surface data atmospheric surface interference constantly encountered. many geoscience variables cannot even measured directly inferred observations model simulations. example airborne imaging spectrometers detect sources methane important greenhouse gas. instruments overhead surveys ground-reﬂected sunlight arriving sensor. methane plumes identiﬁed excess sunlight absorption determine leak rate resulting greenhouse impact must also know fast excess methane mass dispersing. requires considering inﬂuence transport turn requires steady-state physical assumptions morphology-based plume modeling direct in-situ measurements wind speed. even data generated model outputs uncertainties imperfect knowledge initial boundary conditions system parametric forms approximations used model. paucity samples ground truth property small sample size number samples geoscience data sets often limited space time. factors limit sample size include history data collection nature phenomenon measured. example satellite products available since monthly processes considered means less samples available. furthermore many events geosciences important monitor occur infrequently thus resulting small sample sizes. example majority land cover changes landslide tsunami forest rare events occur short temporal durations mostly small spatial regions. less years reliable sensor-based data dozens rare events available training data. limited spatial temporal resolution geoscience variables also limited nature observation methodology. example paleo-climate data derived coral lake sediments tree rings deep core samples available places around earth. similarly early records precipitation exist areas covered land. contrast commercial applications involving internet-scale data e.g. text mining object recognition large volumes labeled unlabeled data major factors behind success machine learning methodologies deep learning. limited number samples geoscience applications along large number physical variables result problems under-constrained nature requiring novel machine learning advances robust analyses. develop machine learning methods learn parsimonious models even paucity labeled data. another possibility construct synthetic data sets simulations perturbation used training make observations. geoscience problems directions geoscientists constantly strive develop better approaches modeling current state earth system evolution well connections within subsystems aimed advancing scientiﬁc understanding geoscience processes. also help providing actionable information informing policy decisions directly impact society boundaries goals often blur practice e.g. improved tornado model simultaneously lead better science model well effective warning system. viewing lens geosciences many methods machine learning natural problems encountered geoscience applications. example classiﬁcation pattern recognition methods useful characterizing objects extreme weather events swarms foreshocks aftershocks estimating geoscience variables producing long-term forecasts state earth system. another example approaches mining relationships causal attribution provide insights inner workings earth system support policy making. following brieﬂy describe broad categories geoscience problems discuss promising machine learning directions examples recent successes relevant problem. property paucity ground truth even though many geoscience applications involve large amounts data e.g. global observations ecosystem variables high spatial temporal resolutions using earth observing satellites common feature geoscience problems paucity labeled samples gold-standard ground truth. high-quality measurements several geoscience variables taken expensive apparatus low-ﬂying airplanes tedious timeconsuming operations ﬁeld-based surveys severely limit collection ground truth samples. geoscience processes ground truth since complexity system exact state system never fully known. paucity representative training samples result poor performance many machine learning methods either underﬁtting model simple overﬁtting model overly complex relative dimensionality features limited number training samples. hence need characterizing objects events machine learning algorithms help characterizing objects events geosciences critical understanding earth system. example analyze patterns geoscience data sets detect climate events cyclogenesis tornadogenesis discover precursors predicting long leads time. analyzing spatial temporal patterns geoscience data also help studying formation movement climate objects weather fronts atmospheric rivers ocean eddies major drivers vital geoscience processes transfer precipitation energy nutrients atmosphere ocean. traditional approaches characterizing geoscience objects events primarily based hand-coded features machine learning algorithms enable automated detection data improved performance using pattern mining techniques. however presence spatio-temporal objects amorphous boundaries associated uncertainties need develop pattern mining approaches account spatial temporal properties geoscience data characterizing objects events. approach successfully used ﬁnding spatio-temporal patterns surface height data resulting creation global catalogue mesoscale ocean eddies another approach ﬁnding anomalous objects buried surface earth radar images explored using unsupervised techniques work mediums varying properties. topic models also explored ﬁnding extreme events climate time series data estimating geoscience variables observations great opportunity machine learning methods infer critical geoscience variables difﬁcult monitor directly e.g. methane concentrations groundwater seepage soil using information variables collected satellites ground-based sensors simulated using earth system models. example supervised machine learning algorithms used analyze remote sensing data produce estimates ecosystem variables forest cover health vegetation water quality surface water availability spatial scales regular intervals time. estimates geoscience variables help informing management decisions enabling scientiﬁc studies changes occurring earth’s surface. major challenge supervised learning approaches
