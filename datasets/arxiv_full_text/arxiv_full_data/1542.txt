{"title": "Robust Dialog State Tracking for Large Ontologies", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "The Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 (DSTC 4) differentiates itself from the previous three editions as follows: the number of slot-value pairs present in the ontology is much larger, no spoken language understanding output is given, and utterances are labeled at the subdialog level. This paper describes a novel dialog state tracking method designed to work robustly under these conditions, using elaborate string matching, coreference resolution tailored for dialogs and a few other improvements. The method can correctly identify many values that are not explicitly present in the utterance. On the final evaluation, our method came in first among 7 competing teams and 24 entries. The F1-score achieved by our method was 9 and 7 percentage points higher than that of the runner-up for the utterance-level evaluation and for the subdialog-level evaluation, respectively.", "text":

improvements. paper organized follows. section describes brieﬂy dstc data set. section presents detail several trackers used challenge. section compares performances test trackers trackers submitted teams participated challenge. section summarizes work proposes improvements. corpus used challenge consists dialog sessions touristic information singapore collected skype calls three tour guides tourists. dialog session dialog guide tourist guide helps tourist plan trip singapore providing recommendations based tourist’s preferences. dialogs utterances words. recorded dialogs total length hours dialog divided subdialogs topic contains several utterances. dialog states annotated subdialog. dialog state represented list slot-value pairs. slot general category value indicates speciﬁcally dialog participants mind. example possible slot type place possible value slot beach. dstc corpus provided ontology speciﬁes list slot-value pairs subdialog given topic contain. following ofﬁcial split train development test sets contain dialogs respectively. remaining dialogs used test another task. test labels released ﬁnal evaluation. goal main task dstc track dialog states considering dialog history including utterance. trackers evaluated based predicted state either utterance subdialog since gold labels available subdialog level utterance-level evaluation predicted state utterance compared gold labels subdialog contains utterance. four performance metrics used subset accuracy precision recall f-score. subset accuracy given utterance list slot-value pairs dialog state must exactly match subdialog gold label counted true positive. contain information pertaining data set. simple rule-based tracker provided organizers challenge. performs string fuzzy matching value ontology utterance. matching score certain threshold value slot-value pair value considered present. cascade tracker aims reﬁne fuzzy matching tracker. slot classiﬁer trained detect whether slot present absent given utterance. slot predicted present given utterance fuzzy matching score computed value detected slot utterance. classiﬁer tried logistic regression support vector machines random forests kept yields best results. features used unigrams bigrams word vectors named-entities. word vector features obtained ﬁrst mapping word utterance word vector summing all. pre-trained word vectors provided wordvec website. main weakness cascade tracker order detect value relies fuzzy matching instead utilizing meaningful features. address issue joint tracker predicts slot value jointly. slot classiﬁer trained detect whether given value present absent. features used cascade tracker. since vast majority values absent given utterance negative examples downsampled training phase. since machine-learning-based approaches using traditional features performing poorly elaborate rule-based tracker constructed order overcome shortcomings machine-learning-based approaches. main pipeline elaborate rule-based tracker described figure tracker makes knowledge present ontology well synonym list deﬁned slot-value pair. inputs dialog state tracker current utterance dialog history. dialog history contains list previous utterances well list slot-value pairs tracker predicted previous utterances. lastly based input knowledge tracker outputs list slot-value pairs current utterances. tracker tries model human would track dialog states therefore intuitive interpretable. figure presents four main steps tracker follows predict output based input knowledge. ﬁrst step detects presence slot-value pair utterance ﬁnding match substring utterance synonyms slot-value pair. second step resolve coreferences certain type detects additional slot-value pairs associated them. among slot-value pairs detected synonym matching coreference resolution often exist group slot-value pairs closely related present dialog state. third step tracker selects likely slot-value pair among closely-related slot-value pairs eliminates others. last step slot-value pairs carried previous dialog state whenever topic continues slot-value pair detected certain slots. following four subsections present step details. motivation behind synonym matching comes observation even slot-value pair included dialog state utterance value appear utterance. instead synonym value often appears substring utterance. example slot-value pair place amoy east hospitality likely synonym value amoy hotel present utterance spoken dialog rather value itself viz. amoy east hospitality therefore slot-value pair associated list synonyms likely present utterances whose dialog state contains slot-value pair. synonym list created partly hand partly using rules. ﬂexibility better detection synonym contain optional speciﬁcations ﬁrst synonym could expressed clause multiple words; second part-of-speech speciﬁed word comprise synonym. synonym clause multiple words corresponding slot-value pair detected words present utterance. allows slot-value pair detected even word order switched. example slot-value pair place amoy east hospitality discussed earlier synonym added corresponding synonym list slot-value pair detected utterance recommend hotel called amoy. word comprises synonym speciﬁed part-of-speech corresponding slot-value pair detected word appears utterance tagged speciﬁed part-of-speech. take account part-of-speech tracker performs part-of-speech tagging utterance prior synonym matching. part-of-speech speciﬁcation allows slot-value pair detected even synonym word exhibited different form. example synonym snorkel verb part-of-speech slotvalue pair activity snorkeling slot-value pair detected utterances like snorkel have snorkeled before? there many people snorkeling beach. another beneﬁt using part-of-speech speciﬁcation helps reduce many false positives distinguishing noun verb instances word. example specifying noun part speech synonym show slot-value pair activity show prevent incorrect detection slot-value pair utterance would like show picture. moreover adopted simple strategies enhance detection slotvalue pairs. first lemmatized word synonyms utterances matching increasing chance detecting plural well singular form synonym. second order account misspellings preserving precision tracker permitted spelling mistake long synonyms only. speciﬁcally allowed synonym detected substring utterance levenshtein distance synonym synonym characters word synonym characters. coreferences numerous dialogs harder detect formal written text existing coreference resolution systems typically perform well latter former. tracker contains coreference resolution system place-related anaphoras. system customized slot-ﬁlling tasks works follows. utterance syntactic parsing tree tracker detects presence following three templates template possessive adjective type place template demonstrative pronoun type place template here/there example hoteland your museums belong template this garden these parks belong template template template present tracker considers present last detected slot-value pair type dialog history. type place-related slot-value pair speciﬁed provided ontology. template present tracker considers present last detected value place-related slots dialog history. among slot-value pairs detected synonym matching coreference resolution often exist group slot-value pairs closely related e.g. different branches hotel chain. situations however slot-value pairs present dialog state. order select likely slot-value pair among closely related slot-value pairs tracker utilizes domain knowledge present ontology well observations training data. example hotel listed possible value ontology also contains additional information hotel neighborhood price range. multiple hotel branches detected synonym matching step tracker checks whether related information branch found context selects likely branch based observation. relevant information found tracker selects likely branch based prior observations training data. another kind closely-related slot-value pairs values overlap other park hotel grand park hotel. utterance stay grand park hotel synonym matching step detect park hotel grand park hotel values. avoid issue tracker deletes slot-value pair whose value substring value another slot-value pair among detected slot-value pairs. slot-value pairs special slots from syntactic parsing trees used order determine whether value follows preposition into towards from. based order values appear utterances subdialog likely slot-value pair determined. dialog progresses many slot-value pairs remain present several subsequent utterances subject dialog continues. result tracker implements following rule certain slots whenever slot-value detected present previous utterance slot-value pair remains present another value appears slot topic changes. tracker learns slots optimal using training data comparing slot-value pair prediction results without rule given slot. order take advantage strength rule-based machinelearning-based approaches hybrid tracker uses rule-based tracker’s outputs features joint tracker. output four main steps elaborate rule-based tracker used features figure illustrates. table compares performances test trackers well best tracker team took part challenge. utterancelevel evaluation teams including obtained f-score reﬂects difﬁculty task. team reached best entry scored token subdialog-level evaluation teams including obtained f-score team reached best entry scored looking results various trackers described section observe cascade tracker joint tracker perform poorly. joint tracker much lower recall cascade tracker fact classiﬁer used values slot. however elaborate rule-based tracker yields much higher performance fuzzy matching baseline. hybrid tracker uses output rule-based tracker features further increases f-score lower subset accuracy. unlike joint tracker hybrid tracker improves f-score result higher quality density features used. results utterance-level evaluation lower subdialoglevel evaluation expected since utterance-level evaluation predicted state utterance compared gold state subdialog contains utterance. often hard impossible ﬁrst utterances subdialog guess state subdialog have since tracker allowed access current previous utterances upcoming utterances. poor performances trackers solely rely machine-learning partly explained lack dialog state labels utterance level. tracker trained using features extracted utterance subdialog label utterance label tracker learn many incorrect associations features labels. words using subdialog labels utterance labels introduce much noise. example subdialog comprises utterances good morning paris subdialog label paris ﬁrst training sample features extracted good morning label paris. tend create false positives since likely good morning subdialogs labeled paris. however tracker trained subdialogs avoid issue results much fewer samples train brings issue data scarcity even though train contains labeled dialogs number training samples still quite small. certainly gives signiﬁcant advantage hybrid trackers machine-learning-based trackers. addition dialog states labels also contain semantic tags utterance. tried take advantage ﬁner granularity semantic tagging experiment used gold semantic tags features results development show improvement. paper describes compares several dialog state trackers dstc corpus. size ontology utterances labeled subdialogue-level only rule-based approach yields better results pure machine learning approaches. however using rule-based tracker features machine-learning-based tracker allows improve results. ﬁnal evaluation main task method came ﬁrst among competing teams entries. method achieved f-score percentage points higher modeled humans would track dialog states elaborate rule-based tracker intuitive interpretable also potential improved combining machine-learning-based approaches. example hybrid tracker many ways machine learning techniques could used improve system. first synonyms list mostly manually curated using existing synonym lists wordnet causing precision decrease signiﬁcantly. general rules used automatically generate synonyms could automate generation synonym list. moreover extending coreference resolution system general slot-value pairs improve performance tracker. furthermore instead blindly carrying slot-value pairs value detected certain slots would interesting implement algorithms detect subject dialog changed carry slot-value pairs subject changed. another weakness system detects slot-value pairs mentioned utterances rather selectively detecting mentioned also main subject discussion. example value mentioned negated e.g. recommend keong saik hotel fullerton hotel. according system slot-value pairs place keong saik hotel place fullerton hotel detected present gold dialog state include former. mistakes result many false positives. implementing algorithms detect main subject greatly improve precision. acknowledgements authors would like warmly thank dstc team organizing
