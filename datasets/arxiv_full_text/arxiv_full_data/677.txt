{"title": "Correntropy Maximization via ADMM - Application to Robust Hyperspectral  Unmixing", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "In hyperspectral images, some spectral bands suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio due to noisy acquisition and atmospheric effects, thus requiring robust techniques for the unmixing problem. This paper presents a robust supervised spectral unmixing approach for hyperspectral images. The robustness is achieved by writing the unmixing problem as the maximization of the correntropy criterion subject to the most commonly used constraints. Two unmixing problems are derived: the first problem considers the fully-constrained unmixing, with both the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints, while the second one deals with the non-negativity and the sparsity-promoting of the abundances. The corresponding optimization problems are solved efficiently using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Experiments on synthetic and real hyperspectral images validate the performance of the proposed algorithms for different scenarios, demonstrating that the correntropy-based unmixing is robust to outlier bands.", "text": "material spectra termed endmembers consider hyperspectral image rl×t denote matrix pixels/spectra spectral bands. t-th column l-th representing l-th band pixels. denotes conventional ℓ-norm. solution conventional least-squares problem given pseudo-inverse endmember matrix ⊤yt. least-squares optimization denotes l-th argument. problem formulations closed-form solution suffer major drawbacks. ﬁrst several constraints need imposed order physical meaning image pixels generated using either linear mixing model polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model gaussian noise }db. endmembers shown fig. drawn usgs digital spectral library endmembers deﬁned continuous bands ppnmm values generated uniformly according imitate noisy bands real hyperspectral images several bands generated data corrupted replacing corresponding number corrupted bands sparsity level abundances studied. image pixels generated linear mixture model. endmember matrix composed usgs signatures angle corrupted bands varies gaussian noise level commonly present real hyperspectral images according sparsity-promoting algorithms regularization parameter adjusted section presents performance proposed algorithms real hyperspectral image. consider sub-image taken cuprite mining image acquired aviris sensor ﬂying vegas nevada usa. range .µm. among relatively noisy ones namely bands geographic composition area estimated include minerals neglecting similar signatures consider endmembers often investigated literature technique ﬁrst applied", "year": 2016}
