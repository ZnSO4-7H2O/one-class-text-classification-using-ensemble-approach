{"title": "On Nonspecific Evidence", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE", "I.2.3; I.5.3"], "abstract": "When simultaneously reasoning with evidences about several different events it is necessary to separate the evidence according to event. These events should then be handled independently. However, when propositions of evidences are weakly specified in the sense that it may not be certain to which event they are referring, this may not be directly possible. In this paper a criterion for partitioning evidences into subsets representing events is established. This criterion, derived from the conflict within each subset, involves minimising a criterion function for the overall conflict of the partition. An algorithm based on characteristics of the criterion function and an iterative optimisation among partitionings of evidences is proposed.", "text": "johan schubert division applied mathematics

judge whether second proposition referring event. instance ﬁrst proposition referring events second proposition referring events three uncertain whether referring event. thus possible separate evidences based proposition’s event parts. instead separate evidences conﬂict. obvious choice since conﬂict measures lack compatibility among evidences action parts propositions likely compatible referring event compared situation referring different events actions also likely different. evidences considered conﬂicting empty intersections representations proposition action parts identical speciﬁc proposition event parts i.e. propositions certainly referring event. however since calculations take place within subsets evidences presumed referring event conﬂict different situations. firstly conﬂict proposition action parts conﬂicting regardless proposition event parts since presumed referring event. secondly proposition event parts conﬂicting then regardless proposition action
