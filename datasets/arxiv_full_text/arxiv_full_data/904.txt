{"title": "A Scalable Deep Neural Network Architecture for Multi-Building and  Multi-Floor Indoor Localization Based on Wi-Fi Fingerprinting", "tag": ["cs.NI", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "One of the key technologies for future large-scale location-aware services covering a complex of multi-story buildings --- e.g., a big shopping mall and a university campus --- is a scalable indoor localization technique. In this paper, we report the current status of our investigation on the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for scalable building/floor classification and floor-level position estimation based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting. Exploiting the hierarchical nature of the building/floor estimation and floor-level coordinates estimation of a location, we propose a new DNN architecture consisting of a stacked autoencoder for the reduction of feature space dimension and a feed-forward classifier for multi-label classification of building/floor/location, on which the multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization system based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting is built. Experimental results for the performance of building/floor estimation and floor-level coordinates estimation of a given location demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DNN-based indoor localization system, which can provide near state-of-the-art performance using a single DNN, for the implementation with lower complexity and energy consumption at mobile devices.", "text": "abstract technologies future large-scale location-aware services covering complex multi-story buildings e.g. shopping mall university campus scalable indoor localization technique. paper report current status investigation deep neural networks scalable building/ﬂoor classiﬁcation ﬂoor-level position estimation based wi-fi ﬁngerprinting. exploiting hierarchical nature building/ﬂoor estimation ﬂoor-level coordinates estimation location propose architecture consisting stacked autoencoder reduction feature space dimension feed-forward classiﬁer multi-label classiﬁcation building/ﬂoor/location multi-building multi-ﬂoor indoor localization system based wi-fi ﬁngerprinting built. experimental results performance building/ﬂoor estimation ﬂoor-level coordinates estimation given location demonstrate feasibility proposed dnn-based indoor localization system provide near state-of-the-art performance using single implementation lower complexity energy consumption mobile devices. keywords multi-building multi-ﬂoor indoor localization;
