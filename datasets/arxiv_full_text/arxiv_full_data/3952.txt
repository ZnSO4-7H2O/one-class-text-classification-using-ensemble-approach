{"title": "On the Effects of Idiotypic Interactions for Recommendation Communities  in Artificial Immune Systems", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "It has previously been shown that a recommender based on immune system idiotypic principles can out perform one based on correlation alone. This paper reports the results of work in progress, where we undertake some investigations into the nature of this beneficial effect. The initial findings are that the immune system recommender tends to produce different neighbourhoods, and that the superior performance of this recommender is due partly to the different neighbourhoods, and partly to the way that the idiotypic effect is used to weight each neighbours recommendations.", "text": "paper present results work undertaken better understand idiotypic effect. order context next section provides definition idiotypic effect following brief review artificial immune system based recommenders. present discuss results analysis date. idiotypic network hypothesis first proposed jerne builds recognition antibodies match antibodies well antigens. hence antibody matched antibodies turn matched antibodies. activation continue spread population. idiotypic network formalised number theoretical immunologists theory could help explain memory past infections maintained. furthermore could result suppression similar antibodies thus encouraging diversity antibody pool. previously recommender based immune system idiotypic principles outperform based correlation alone. paper reports results work progress undertake investigations nature beneficial effect. initial findings immune system recommender tends produce different neighbourhoods superior performance recommender partly different neighbourhoods partly idiotypic effect used weight neighbour’s recommendations. idiotypic effect builds premise antibodies match antibodies well antigens. first proposed jerne formalised model farmer theory currently debated immunologists clear consensus effects humoral immune system previous paper shown incorporation idiotypic effects beneficial artificial immune system based recommender systems. however mechanisms beneficial effect. exploration would seem worthwhile particularly results identifying underlying causes improvements ‘characteristics’ community effect generally useful range applications recommender systems provide addition deeper understanding idiotypic effect prove useful designers artificial immune system applications. previous work compared predictors based simple pearson test artificial immune system. case test user taken database predictions recommendations made user. predictors work finding neighbourhood using neighbourhood produce predictions recommendations. prediction quality assessed measuring mean absolute error recommendation quality assessed comparing ranked recommendations user’s ranked ratings recommended films. kendall’s applied. measure reflects level concordance lists proceeds counting number discordant pairs. order films actual vote apply following formulae recommended films seen equation nature idiotypic interaction either positive negative. moreover matching function symmetric balance recognised antibodies recognised wholly determines whether idiotypic effect positive negative simplify equation. simplify equation still allow antigen artificial immune system. simplified equation looks like this recommender systems collaborative filtering recommendations example movie recommender system would given film provide prediction film might also provide list recommended films comparing users together similar antigen different other. process thus subject suppression similar antibodies following jerne’s idiotypic ideas mentioned above. thus time artificial immune system contains high concentrations diverse users similar film preferences target user. algorithm terminated either users artificial immune system stabilised i.e. full changed consistency iterations. concentrations correlations users final neighbourhood i.e. final immune system iteration simple pearson case neighbourhood composed ‘top correlated users correlation measured simple pearson statistical measure. artificial immune system case neighbourhood created building immune system test user antigen neighbours antibodies simple pearson measure matching function. behaviour neighbourhood governed equation poorly performing antibodies deleted neighbourhood. note treated idiotypic effect suppressive. although artificial immune system simple pearson recommender algorithms based pearson correlations differently number reasons choice neighbours different. simple pearson highest correlated users chosen form neighbourhood. artificial immune system general rule followed except stimulation adds threshold idiotypic effect adds diversity. even given neighbours weighting different. simple pearson neighbour weight neighbour test user. artificial immune system antibody’s concentration turn determined running artificial immune system algorithm neighbourhood. deal first point stimulation rate provides fixed threshold correlation antibody antigen. even absence idiotypic interactions antibody’s correlation must outweigh death rate;
