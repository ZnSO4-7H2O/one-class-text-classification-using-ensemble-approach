{"title": "Self-Taught Support Vector Machine", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach for classification of target task using limited labeled target data as well as enormous unlabeled source data is proposed which is called self-taught learning. The target and source data can be drawn from different distributions. In the previous approaches, covariate shift assumption is considered where the marginal distributions p(x) change over domains and the conditional distributions p(y|x) remain the same. In our approach, we propose a new objective function which simultaneously learns a common space T(.) where the conditional distributions over domains p(T(x)|y) remain the same and learns robust SVM classifiers for target task using both source and target data in the new representation. Hence, in the proposed objective function, the hidden label of the source data is also incorporated. We applied the proposed approach on Caltech-256, MSRC+LMO datasets and compared the performance of our algorithm to the available competing methods. Our method has a superior performance to the successful existing algorithms.", "text": "figure target samples source samples transformation. source target samples plot distributions target source domains significantly different. source target samples transformed domain minimum distance means domain marginal distribution conditional distribution. figure sample images msrc dataset image level label ‘grass’ ‘cow’ ‘water’ ‘boat’. incompleteness image-level high similarities ‘cow grass’ ‘water boat’ images. figure performance comparison true recognition rate respect number positive samples target data. positive target data sampled semantic class ‘cow’ msrc dataset samples source data randomly drawn dataset. figure classification accuracy class pair stsvm stsvm-i dtsvm svm. approach many pair classes achieves highest recognition rate. experiment repeated times mean recognition rates reported. figure classification accuracy class pair stsvm stsvm-i dtsvm svm. approach many pair classes achieves highest recognition rate. experiment repeated times mean recognition rates reported. yang survey transfer learning\" ieee transactions knowledge data engineering vol. chen guoping shihai \"learning progressive transductive support vector machine.\" pattern recognition letters vol. gammerman vovk vapnik \"learning transduction\" uncertainty artificial intelligence quionero-candela sugiyama schwaighofer lawrence dataset shift machine learning press yang survey transfer learning\" ieee transactions knowledge data engineering vol. sugiyama kawanabe machine learning non-stationary environments introduction covariate shift adaptation press orabona castellini caputo fiorilla sandini \"model adaptation leastsquares hand prosthetics\" icra tommasi orabona caputo \"safety numbers learning categories examples multi model knowledge transfer\" computer vision pattern recognition ablavsky becker \"transfer learning sharing support vectors\" epfl-report-. raina battle packer \"self-taught learning transfer learning unlabeled data\" international conference machine learning duan tsang maybank \"domain transfer video concept detectio\" ieee conference cvpr \"self-taught low-rank coding visual learning\" ieee transactions neural networks learning systems likelihood function\" journal statistical planning inference vol. bickel bruckner scheffer \"discriminative learning differing training test distributions\" international conference machine learning ben-david blitzer crammer kulesza pereira vaughan theory learning different domains\" mach. learn. vol. germain habrard laviolette morvant pac-bayesian approach domain adaptation specialization linear classifiers\" international conference machine learning germain habrard laviolette morvant pac-bayesian perspective domain adaptation.\" international conference machine learning gong zhang glymour schölkopf \"domain adaptation conditional transferable components\" international conference machine learning long \"topic correlation analysis cross-domain text classification\" aaai university. bruzzone marconcini \"domain adaptation problems dasvm classification technique circular validation strategy\" ieee transactions pattern analysis machine intelligence vol. morvant \"domain adaptation weighted majority votes perturbed variation-based selflabeling\" pattern recognition letters vol. laviolette marchand \"from pac-bayes bounds quadratic programs majority votes\" international conference machine learning shotton johnson cipolla \"semantic texton forests image categorization segmentation\" computer vision pattern recognition yuen torralba \"nonparametric scene parsing label transfer dense scene alignment\" computer vision pattern recognition lazebnik schmid ponce \"beyond bags features spatial pyramid matching recognizing natural scene categories\" computer vision pattern recognition computer vision pattern recognition ojala pietikäinen mäenpää \"multiresolution gray-scale rotation invariant texture classification local binary pattern\" ieee trans. pattern anal. mach. intell.", "year": 2017}
