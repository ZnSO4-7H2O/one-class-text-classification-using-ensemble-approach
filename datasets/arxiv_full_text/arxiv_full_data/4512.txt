{"title": "Clusters, Graphs, and Networks for Analysing Internet-Web-Supported  Communication within a Virtual Community", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "I.5.3"], "abstract": "The proposal is to use clusters, graphs and networks as models in order to analyse the Web structure. Clusters, graphs and networks provide knowledge representation and organization. Clusters were generated by co-site analysis. The sample is a set of academic Web sites from the countries belonging to the European Union. These clusters are here revisited from the point of view of graph theory and social network analysis. This is a quantitative and structural analysis. In fact, the Internet is a computer network that connects people and organizations. Thus we may consider it to be a social network. The set of Web academic sites represents an empirical social network, and is viewed as a virtual community. The network structural properties are here analysed applying together cluster analysis, graph theory and social network analysis.", "text": "bstract proposal clusters graphs networks models order

number sites considered data set. data matrix recorded number hyperlinks sites diagonal self-hyperlinks denoted rows directed hyperlinks denoted sites. data matrix directly analyse directed graph consisting nodes directed arcs pairs nodes. study directed graph terms though choice built another reality represented co-occurrence matrix. matrix patterns hidden data matrix become uncovered constitute building block analysis. hidden pattern co-occurrence pair sites hyperlinks. approach adopted called co-site analysis consists recognizing couples sites. co-site defined frequency sites co-associated together out-hyperlinks sites. co-site analysis agrees patterns co-citation co-word analysis approaches follow general co-occurrence model. difference level object considered co-occur. thus possible uncover relationship among pair items exist first directly approach. co-site relationship established hyperlinks sites. co-site frequency sites determined computing lists outgoing hyperlinks sites web. sites located hyperlinks sites given sample number sites origin hyperlinks defines frequency co-occurrence sites. linking item simply site hyperlinks sites. co-site frequency sites associated together hyperlinks sites. measuring co-site strength measure degree relationship association sites perceived population hyperlinking sites. patterns changed time dependence hyperlinking sites. vocabulary co-occurrences change subject domains evolve. hyperlinking sites initiating hyperlink terminates sites receiving hyperlink. distinction citing cited co-citation analysis. co-site patterns change interest information exchange patterns considered field change. sites frequently associated hyperlinks sites also necessarily frequently pointed hyperlinks sites individually well. frequently pointed sites maybe represent sites given domain. thus co-site patterns used relationships sites. allows modelling communication structure particular sites. changes co-sites patterns considered period time provide clues understanding mechanism domain development. network co-sites generated specific sectors submitted clustering. clusters co-sites provide study structure. general clustering method attempts reorganize entities relatively homogeneous groups. thus clusters represent groups highly similar sites. similarity based degree relationship association exists entities. used association coefficient measure degree similarity sites described binary data refers presence variable absence. clustering method used hierarchical agglomerative method following single linkage rule. result clusters task produce network clusters cluster network following graph theory. cluster consists five sets information components internal associations pairs components external associations pairs components belonging different clusters values attached associations finally sites clustered. associations relationships strength value. relations based co-occurrence. cluster represents valued graph. next section deal inter-cluster relations graphtheoretic terms. following degenne foss√© wasserman faust shall revisit mainly relations clusters called inter-cluster relations according graph-theoretic concepts. cluster node thus equal nodes. illustration co-site network shown figure numbered network diagram represents cluster co-sites. inter-cluster relations directional valued relations. thus network clusters would represent valued directed graph. simplifying graph displayed figure however conforms following restriction. binary directed graph strength values well amount relations clusters considered. restriction forms natural starting point modelling network clusters. introduces minimum amount arbitrary structure whilst still allowing meaningful questions asked network whole. inter-cluster relations directional relations. relation directional relation oriented node another. directed relations pairs nodes represented lines directions relations specified arrowheads. oriented lines called arcs. ordered pair nodes reflecting direction relation nodes. igure directed graph representing clusters interrelations. numbered represents cluster co-sites. directions inter-cluster relations specified arrowheads. possible arcs ordered pair distinct nodes directed origin sender node terminus receiver node. node incident node ordered pair nodes defining arc. nodes incident since ordered pair nodes distinguish first second node pair must consider given node sender receiver ordered pair defining arc. formally node adjacent node node adjacent

cluster returned another originating terminating directed graph digraph three types relations occur pairs nodes mutual nodes directing relations toward other shown two-headed arrows asymmetric node directs relations toward another reciprocated null relation either direction exists pair nodes. figure shows three types relations. patterns observed figure might also observe graph complete. graph said complete possible relations nodes present. mentioned above network clusters consists valued relations strength relation recorded. case valued relations valued graphs appropriate graph-theoretic representation. valued graph valued directed graph graph line carries value. valued graph consists three sets information nodes lines values vv}. associated line value real numbers. case values result formula denotes number co-occurrences pair sites receivers hyperlinks sites; number occurrences sites receivers hyperlinks sites. valued graph relation node node identical relation node node thus single value unordered pair nodes. case intra-cluster structure. case relations among clusters inter-cluster relations obey ordered pair nodes effects clustering method. order imposed level clusters order creation clusters. relation undirected valued relation single value pair nodes belongs different clusters. network clusters represented valued directed graph cluster valued undirected graph. valued directed graph weighted digraph represents directional valued relation amount links site site. site address different amount links site site address site valued directed graph node node node node thus distinct values possible ordered pair nodes. general necessarily equal inter-cluster relations among clusters analysed terms valued directed graph. values consider strength values relation pair sites out-degree in-degree values cluster. simplifying graph displayed figure however binary directed graph strength values well amount relations clusters considered. graph built square matrix out-degree in-degree binary values cluster equal number clusters in-degrees out-degrees useful measurements particular type networks relations information exchange occurs. graph degree node denoted number nodes adjacent equivalently number lines incident digraph node either adjacent adjacent another node depending direction arc. interesting consider cases separately. since quantifies tendency nodes senders; quantifies tendency receive. node degree equal called isolate. example inter-clusters relationships clusters high out-degree recognized senders clusters high in-degree heavy receivers exchange information. also isolated clusters. note clusters co-sites. discover isolated subset sites within network. isolate means close inside cluster without connections cluster. also pairs clusters distinguished; related together without relations clusters. thus together isolated others network. terms in-degrees out-degrees nodes directed graph distinguish four different kinds nodes node
