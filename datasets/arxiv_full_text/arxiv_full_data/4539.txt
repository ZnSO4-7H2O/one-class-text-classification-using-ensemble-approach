{"title": "Machine Learning: When and Where the Horses Went Astray?", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Machine Learning is usually defined as a subfield of AI, which is busy with information extraction from raw data sets. Despite of its common acceptance and widespread recognition, this definition is wrong and groundless. Meaningful information does not belong to the data that bear it. It belongs to the observers of the data and it is a shared agreement and a convention among them. Therefore, this private information cannot be extracted from the data by any means. Therefore, all further attempts of Machine Learning apologists to justify their funny business are inappropriate.", "text": "year exceptionally cruel almost papers submitted year conferences rejected.

challenge nothing field changed since past century first steps artificial intelligence exploration carried trying claim clever wise others. stupid things others persistently tried repeatedly tried well. thing however certainly different others never neglected final goal grasp information content image. together image-processing partisans camarados fought pixel-oriented battles dream objectoriented image processing always blooming heart. understand nothing worthy come that. nevertheless things lucky make happen worth mentioned here. example invented notion single pixel information

several orders lower fovea resolution scale clear information gathering maps used simultaneously interchangeably. considerations inevitably conclusion theories currently unknown would capable explaining multiscale brain performance urgently searched for. indeed soon came upon appropriate theory. even single whole bundle theories. middle previous century three almost simultaneous absolutely independently developed theories sprung solomonoff’s theory inference kolmogorov’s complexity theory chaitin’s algorithmic information theory since among three kolmogorov’s theory known first mainly refer discussion. shannon’s information theory published almost years ahead kolmogorov’s theory aimed providing means measuring information. however shannon’s theory dealing average amount information conveyed outcome random source kolmogorov’s theory busy information contained particular isolated object. thus kolmogorov’s theory suitable deal human vision peculiarities. however intend bother readers explanations kolmogorov’s theory merits. expanded enlightenment could found else where example humble intention relying insights kolmogorov’s theory provide useful illuminations deduced theory applied practice image information content excavation. essential part work already done past years even published several occasions however consistency discussion would like repeat main points previous publications. point information description certain alphabet-based languagebased description kolmogorov’s theory regards program that executed trustworthy reproduces original object image objects visible data structures image comprised reproducible descriptions image data structures information contained image. kolmogorov’s theory prescribes descriptions must created first simplified generalized structure must described. recall occam’s razor principle among hypotheses consistent observation choose simplest cohirent data then level generalization gradually decreased fine-grained image details become revealed depicted. second important point follows theory’s pure mathematical considerations image information hierarchy decreasing level descriptions information details unfolds coarse-to-fine top-down manner. third prominent point immediately pops-up mentioned above top-down manner image information elicitation require incorporation high-level knowledge successful accomplishment. totally free high-level guiding rules inspirations. call information unconditionally found image physical information. information reflects objective structures image totally independent high level interpretation interrelashions them. immediately follows high-level image semantics integrated part image information content cannot seen natural property image. semantic information therefore must seen property human observer watches scrutinizes image. semantics assigned image human observer. strongly variance contemporary views concept semantic information. mentioned above intention argue mainstream experts conference chaires keynotes speekers invited talks presenters validity contemplations philosophical inclinations research duties preferences. respected gentlemans would continue teach extract semantic information image derived low-level information features. okay really sorry instead dealing declared subject paper return topics already discussed past even published previous occasions. therefore apologies continue discourse extended citations seized previously published papers first citation related physical information processing issues taken five years paper citation subject algorithmic implementation image physical information mining principles. algorithm’s block-scheme looks follows seen fig. proposed schema comprised three main processing paths bottom-up processing path top-down processing path stack discovered information content actually accumulated. algorithm’s structure reflects principles information representation already defined previously. shown schema input image initially squeezed small size approximately pixels. rules shrinking operation simple fast four non-overlapping neighbor pixels image level averaged result assigned pixel higher -level image. known four children parent relationship. then shrinking pyramid image segmented segmented region labeled. since image size significantly reduced since course bottom-up image squeezing severe data averaging attained image segmentation/labeling procedure demand special computational resources. well-known segmentation methodology suffice. proprietary technique based low-level information content evaluation obligatory. point top-down processing path commenced. level previously defined maps expanded size image nearest lower level. since regions different hierarchical levels exhibit significant changes characteristic intensity majority newly assigned pixels determined sufficiently correct manner. pixels region borders seeds newly emerging regions

architecture must preceded remarks semantic information property external observer separated dissociated physical information processing case image. therefore must treated accordance observerspecific cognitive information processing rules. well known human cognitive abilities empowered existence huge knowledge base things surrounding world kept human brain. knowledge base permanently upgraded updated human’s life span. intend endow design cognitive capabilities provide something equivalent knowledge base. goes without saying knowledge base never large developed human prototype. sure requirement valid here. humans also equal cognitive capacities content knowledge bases diversified well. knowledge base visual thinking machine small enough effective manageable sufficiently large ensure machine acceptable performance. certainly feasibility study satisfied even relatively small specific-task-oriented knowledge base. next crucial point knowledge representation issue. deal first

internet revolution access exchange semantic information viewed prime ultimate goal. machines supposed handle documents’ semantic content machine learning techniques thus supporting knowledge mining venture supposed leading force centre forward exciting enterprise. semantic knowledge mining hottest topic every conference discussion recent research projects many applied science initiatives. however light definition information recently introduced work re-introduced section paper really skeptic machine learning ability meet challenge. again philosophy would place here. first must

published important interesting twist philosophy intelligent artificial systems design. result understanding principals biological systems intelligence proudly declared biological inspirations. contrary results pure mathematical considerations kolmogorov’s complexity theory. drawing insights kolmogorov’s theory seize interpretation facts usually come across natural surrounding. subtle issue among topics machine intelligence would like address. biologically inspired means borrow nature fruitful ideas intend replicate artificial designs. presume understand least close state understanding
