{"title": "Quadratic Upper Bound for Recursive Teaching Dimension of Finite VC  Classes", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In this work we study the quantitative relation between the recursive teaching dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of finite sizes. The RTD of a concept class $\\mathcal C \\subseteq \\{0, 1\\}^n$, introduced by Zilles et al. (2011), is a combinatorial complexity measure characterized by the worst-case number of examples necessary to identify a concept in $\\mathcal C$ according to the recursive teaching model.  For any finite concept class $\\mathcal C \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^n$ with $\\mathrm{VCD}(\\mathcal C)=d$, Simon & Zilles (2015) posed an open problem $\\mathrm{RTD}(\\mathcal C) = O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD? Previously, the best known result is an exponential upper bound $\\mathrm{RTD}(\\mathcal C) = O(d \\cdot 2^d)$, due to Chen et al. (2016). In this paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\\mathrm{RTD}(\\mathcal C) = O(d^2)$, much closer to an answer to the open problem. We also discuss the challenges in fully solving the problem.", "text": "work study quantitative relation recursive teaching dimension dimension concept classes ﬁnite sizes. concept class introduced zilles combinatorial complexity measure characterized worst-case number examples necessary identify concept according recursive teaching model. ﬁnite concept class simon zilles posed open problem i.e. linearly upper bounded vcd?
