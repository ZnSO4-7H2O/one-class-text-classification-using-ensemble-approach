{"title": "Online Robust Principal Component Analysis with Change Point Detection", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.AP", "stat.CO", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Robust PCA methods are typically batch algorithms which requires loading all observations into memory before processing. This makes them inefficient to process big data. In this paper, we develop an efficient online robust principal component methods, namely online moving window robust principal component analysis (OMWRPCA). Unlike existing algorithms, OMWRPCA can successfully track not only slowly changing subspace but also abruptly changed subspace. By embedding hypothesis testing into the algorithm, OMWRPCA can detect change points of the underlying subspaces. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of OMWRPCA compared with other state-of-art approaches. We also apply the algorithm for real-time background subtraction of surveillance video.", "text": "robust methods typically batch algorithms requires loading observations memory processing. makes ineﬃcient process data. paper develop eﬃcient online robust principal component methods namely online moving window robust principal component analysis unlike existing algorithms omwrpca successfully track slowly changing subspace also abruptly changed subspace. embedding hypothesis testing algorithm omwrpca detect change points underlying subspaces. extensive simulation studies demonstrate superior performance omwrpca compared state-of-art approaches. also apply algorithm real-time background subtraction surveillance video. bold letters denote vectors matrices. represent ℓ-norm ℓ-norm vector respectively. arbitrary real matrix kakf denotes frobenius norm matrix kak∗ denotes nuclear norm matrix distribution. generate burnin samples based make slowly change time adding matrics ˜uk}k generated independently i.i.d. figure plots errl errs running times simulation study slowly changing subspace. setting plots stoc-rpca omwrpca omwrpca-cp arranged left right. figure plots errl errs simulation study slowly changing subspace change points. setting plots stoc-rpca omwrpca omwrpca-cp arranged left right.", "year": 2017}
