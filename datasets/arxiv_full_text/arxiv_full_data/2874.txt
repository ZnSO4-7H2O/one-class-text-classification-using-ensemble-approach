{"title": "Causal Inference on Discrete Data via Estimating Distance Correlations", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with the problem of inferring causal directions when the data is on discrete domain. By considering the distribution of the cause $P(X)$ and the conditional distribution mapping cause to effect $P(Y|X)$ as independent random variables, we propose to infer the causal direction via comparing the distance correlation between $P(X)$ and $P(Y|X)$ with the distance correlation between $P(Y)$ and $P(X|Y)$. We infer \"$X$ causes $Y$\" if the dependence coefficient between $P(X)$ and $P(Y|X)$ is smaller. Experiments are performed to show the performance of the proposed method.", "text": "paper deal problem inferring causal directions data discrete domain. considering distribution cause conditional
