The backbone of our system is a deep convolutional neural network that is not only computationally inexpensive, but also provides state-of-the-art results on several competitive benchmarks. Additionally, our deep network is trained on a large dataset of several million images which are labeled through a semi-automated process. Finally we test our system on several public datasets as well as our own internal test dataset. Our results show that we outperform other methods on all benchmarks by significant margins. Our model is available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at https://www.sighthound.com/products/cloud", "text": "abstract. paper describes details sighthound’s fully automated vehicle make model color recognition system. backbone system deep convolutional neural network computationally inexpensive also provides state-of-the-art results several competitive benchmarks. additionally deep network trained large dataset several million images labeled semi-automated process. finally test system several public datasets well internal test dataset. results show outperform methods benchmarks signiﬁcant margins. model available developers sighthound cloud https//www.sighthound.com/products/cloud make model color recognition vehicles great interest several applications law-enforcement driver assistance surveillance traﬃc monitoring. ﬁne-grained visual classiﬁcation task traditionally diﬃcult task computers. main challenge subtle diﬀerences classes compared traditional classiﬁcation tasks imagenet. recently eﬀorts design accurate algorithms mmcr works sochor hsieh moreover many researchers focused collecting large datasets facilitate research area however complexity current methods and/or small size current datasets lead sub-optimal performance real world cases. thus still considerable short-comings agencies commercial entities looking deploy reliable software task mmcr. paper present system capable detecting tagging make model color vehicles irrespective viewing angle high accuracy. model trained recognize diﬀerent vehicle makes well diﬀerent models believe largest available commercial commercial use. contributions sighthound’s vehicle mmcr system listed follows date collected believe largest vehicle dataset consisting million images labeled corresponding vehicle make model. additionally labeled part data corresponding labels vehicle color. overview system shown figure training consists -stage processing pipeline including data collection data pre-processing deep training. data collection plays important role ﬁnal results thus collecting data requires least eﬀort labeling great importance. collected large dataset diﬀerent sets annotations. images annotated corresponding vehicle make model part data annotated vehicle colors order prepare ﬁnal training data process images eliminate eﬀect background. finally images separate deep neural networks train ﬁnal model. data collection data collection plays important role training deep neural network especially comes ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation tasks. address issue collected largest vehicle dataset known date image labeled corresponding make model vehicle. initially collected million images various sources. developed semi-automated process partially prune data remove undesired images. ﬁnally used team human annotators remove remaining errors dataset. ﬁnal data contains million images vehicles corresponding make model tags. additionally labeled part data corresponding color vehicle chosen colors;
