{"title": "DeepWriterID: An End-to-end Online Text-independent Writer  Identification System", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Owing to the rapid growth of touchscreen mobile terminals and pen-based interfaces, handwriting-based writer identification systems are attracting increasing attention for personal authentication, digital forensics, and other applications. However, most studies on writer identification have not been satisfying because of the insufficiency of data and difficulty of designing good features under various conditions of handwritings. Hence, we introduce an end-to-end system, namely DeepWriterID, employed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to address these problems. A key feature of DeepWriterID is a new method we are proposing, called DropSegment. It designs to achieve data augmentation and improve the generalized applicability of CNN. For sufficient feature representation, we further introduce path signature feature maps to improve performance. Experiments were conducted on the NLPR handwriting database. Even though we only use pen-position information in the pen-down state of the given handwriting samples, we achieved new state-of-the-art identification rates of 95.72% for Chinese text and 98.51% for English text.", "text": "abstract—owing rapid growth touchscreen mobile terminals pen-based interfaces handwriting-based writer identification systems attracting increasing attention personal

experiments chinese text evaluate proposed dropsegment method. dropsegment flexible produces varying results randomly generates certain number test samples prototypes. therefore makes sense combine results achieve better performance without re-training models. averaged predictions test stage experiments. page-level performance shown table notice dropsegment identification rates markedly improved without dropsegment. pseudo character segmentation. strokes separated segments character segmentation follows using assumption width character roughly estimated height. fact need accurate segmentation character writer identification task therefore apply pseudo character segmentation process without loss discriminant information different writers. unify size inputs height-to-width ratio same. thus determined ratio simplicity. experiments found ratio value also proper produce similar result. pseudo character segmentation average height measured first. then segments sequentially assigned form pseudo character. width character exceeds average height adding segment segment regarded beginning character. worth note pseudo characters formed always meaningful uniformly similar square shape. since input samples required writer identification task independent meanings essential employ accurate segmentation according meaningful characters. samples generated contains non-character consists letters instead single letter word found samples prevent useful effective training data writer identification. dropsegment implementation data preprocessing data pages separated characters segments. implementation iteration first randomly select mini-batch characters. character contains segments segments random number removed; removed segments also randomly chosen. dropsegment using setting generates considerable quantity samples also prevents much information loss. examples mentioned section numbers generated characters reduce respectively. notice remaining segments appear fragmented destroy writing styles combining segments necessary. character removal segments remaining segments concatenated prototype character recombined form longer segments. that isolated segment individually become stroke. hence dropsegment maintain identity information achieving data augmentation. investigation path-signature feature experiment employed single dcnn described section training stage
