{"title": "Automatic post-picking using MAPPOS improves particle image detection  from Cryo-EM micrographs", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies using single particle reconstruction are extensively used to reveal structural information on macromolecular complexes. Aiming at the highest achievable resolution, state of the art electron microscopes automatically acquire thousands of high-quality micrographs. Particles are detected on and boxed out from each micrograph using fully- or semi-automated approaches. However, the obtained particles still require laborious manual post-picking classification, which is one major bottleneck for single particle analysis of large datasets. We introduce MAPPOS, a supervised post-picking strategy for the classification of boxed particle images, as additional strategy adding to the already efficient automated particle picking routines. MAPPOS employs machine learning techniques to train a robust classifier from a small number of characteristic image features. In order to accurately quantify the performance of MAPPOS we used simulated particle and non-particle images. In addition, we verified our method by applying it to an experimental cryo-EM dataset and comparing the results to the manual classification of the same dataset. Comparisons between MAPPOS and manual post-picking classification by several human experts demonstrated that merely a few hundred sample images are sufficient for MAPPOS to classify an entire dataset with a human-like performance. MAPPOS was shown to greatly accelerate the throughput of large datasets by reducing the manual workload by orders of magnitude while maintaining a reliable identification of non-particle images.", "text": "adiga w.t. baxter r.j. hall rockel b.k. rath frank glaeser particle picking segmentation comparative study spider-based manual particle picking. struct biol arbelaez b.g. typke r.m. glaeser malik experimental evaluation support vector machine-based correlation-based approaches automatic particle selection. struct biol becker franckenberg wickles c.j. shoemaker a.m. anger j.p. armache sieber ungewickell berninghausen daberkow karcher thomm k.p. hopfner green beckmann structural basis highly conserved ribosome recycling eukaryotes archaea. nature borovinskaya m.a. r.d. zhang b.s. schuwirth j.m. holton hirokawa kaji kaji j.h. cate structural basis aminoglycoside inhibition bacterial ribosome recycling. struct biol breiman bagging predictors. machine learning burma srivastava srivastava dash interconversion tight loose couple ribosomes translocation protein synthesis. journal biological chemistry duda r.o. p.e. hart d.g. stork pattern classification wiley sons. fawcett introduction analysis. pattern recognition letters frank radermacher penczek ladjadj leith spider processing visualization images electron microscopy related fields. struct biol leidig bange kopp amlacher aravind wickles witte beckmann sinning structural characterization eukaryotic chaperoneâ€”the ribosomeassociated complex. struct biol. mika ratsch weston scholkopf mullers fisher discriminant analysis kernels neural networks signal processing proceedings ieee signal processing society workshop. ieee ogura sato auto-accumulation method using simulated annealing enables fully automatic particle pickup completely free matching template learning data. struct biol shaikh t.r. w.t. baxter f.j. asturias boisset leith frank spider image processing single-particle reconstruction biological macromolecules electron micrographs. protoc sorzano c.o. recarte alcorlo j.r. bilbao-castro san-martin marabini j.m. carazo automatic particle selection electron micrographs using machine learning techniques. struct biol voss n.r. c.k. yoshioka radermacher c.s. potter carragher picker tiltpicker software tools facilitate particle selection single particle electron microscopy. struct biol carragher r.m. glaeser fellmann bajaj bern mouche haas r.j. hall d.j. kriegman s.j. ludtke s.p. mallick p.a. penczek a.m. roseman f.j. sigworth volkmann c.s. potter automatic particle selection results comparative study. struct biol", "year": 2012}
