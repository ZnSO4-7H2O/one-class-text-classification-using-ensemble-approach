{"title": "Learning Polytrees", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We consider the task of learning the maximum-likelihood polytree from data. Our first result is a performance guarantee establishing that the optimal branching (or Chow-Liu tree), which can be computed very easily, constitutes a good approximation to the best polytree. We then show that it is not possible to do very much better, since the learning problem is NP-hard even to approximately solve within some constant factor.", "text": "take first step direction task learning rected acyclic rections polytrees turned important probabilistic permit ference wish find polytree simplified ings often called chickering general node constrained model uses bayesian learning modified accommodate work. justlikept except node parents clear easier structure able obtain optimal constitutes tree. second cause constant find -polytree within input optimal np-hard find -polytree best knowledge result learning result although class branchings less expressive general rather tremendous advantage sample complexity parent timated interesting instance friedman geiger used branchings morris branchings. work reconstructing given data actually bution pearl perez blanca approximate although gradient performance guarantees guarantees along different pared much confidence example. andx independent random coin flips adding edges reduce one. however proper information cost candidate range interesting optimal tropy) discovered. notation. optimal whenever talk ''parents\" forth parent tions \"child\" node inedges edges. node ancestors. graph polytree nodes directed signify node parents remains extend� subgraphs lxetz finally paper base two. proof. optimal chosen letter helpful tropy rating polytree prove theorem. optimal degree structure effectively ample particular least lsi+ sources connected -tu. remove edge instead edge effect moving change every node graph either ancestors maybe fixed value associated node values later also case useful degree manner alter components bound ratio best polytree sider poly tree structured single exclusive-or small entropy level approximately sink entropy polytree branching cost extra nodes independent thing contain i.i.d. called constants expanded include account polytree con­ edges straint choice pick edges optimal configuration cost least permit inedges part however edges pro­ vide information therefore chosen short gadgets nodes overall thus algorithm optimal prove this? good polytree tell satisfying learned take meaning clause satisfied account variable showing well-defined. need make sure clauses variable able. example above variable polarity instance since edges would contra­ dictory would mean imposes penalty choose thath define assume start structure edges first second layers goal learning algo­ rithm edges bring cost much possible. edges likely add? possible parents depicted", "year": 2013}
