{"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning for Detecting Human Trafficking", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Human trafficking is one of the most atrocious crimes and among the challenging problems facing law enforcement which demands attention of global magnitude. In this study, we leverage textual data from the website \"Backpage\"- used for classified advertisement- to discern potential patterns of human trafficking activities which manifest online and identify advertisements of high interest to law enforcement. Due to the lack of ground truth, we rely on a human analyst from law enforcement, for hand-labeling a small portion of the crawled data. We extend the existing Laplacian SVM and present S3VM-R, by adding a regularization term to exploit exogenous information embedded in our feature space in favor of the task at hand. We train the proposed method using labeled and unlabeled data and evaluate it on a fraction of the unlabeled data, herein referred to as unseen data, with our expert's further verification. Results from comparisons between our method and other semi-supervised and supervised approaches on the labeled data demonstrate that our learner is effective in identifying advertisements of high interest to law enforcement", "text": "abstract human traﬃcking atrocious crimes among challenging problems facing enforcement demands attention global magnitude. study leverage textual data website

features could amongst strong indicators human traﬃcking. brieﬂy describe group features used work. note feature listed ultimately treated binary variable. ensure anonymity traﬃckers would deploy techniques generate diverse information hence make posts look complicated. usually avoid identiﬁed either human analysts automated programs. thus obtain third feature take approach complexity theory namely kolmogorov complexity deﬁned length shortest program reproduce string characters universal machine turing machine since kolmogorov complexity computable approximate complexity advertisement

features word-level n-grams common language patterns advertisements. particular choice fact character-level n-grams already shown useful detecting unwanted content spam detection range compute normalized n-grams advertisement content. ultimately create matrix whose rows columns correspond advertisements contents associated -grams respectively. rank elements matrix descending order pick ones. finally advertisement content elements column numbers associated elements chosen. features added feature set. overall features related language advertisement. despite fact advertisements

based label spreading approach radial basis function k-nearest neighbors kernels co-training learner support vector machines classiﬁers sake fair comparison algorithms implemented python. speciﬁcally python package cvxopt used implement laplacian support vector machines approaches implemented help scikit-learn package python. note methods require special tuning parameters performed grid search choose best parameters. going further ﬁrst deﬁne main parameters used method demonstrate best values picked grid search. discussion eﬀect varying hyperparameters learner provided section here ﬁrst evaluate entire approaches small portion data already know labels i.e. labeled examples. note expert-generated judgmental labeling might error-prone though served surrogate ground truth problem. used -fold cross-validation labeled data following way. ﬁrst divided labeled samples diﬀerent sets approximately equal size. time held validation used remaining along unlabeled samples training–this performed approaches sake fair comparison. finally reported average diﬀerent runs using diﬀerent combinations feature spaces various evaluation metrics including area curve accuracy precision recall f-score. table reported average accuracy method feature space. hand precision recall f-score reported separate results feature space tables respectively. note tables includes separate scores positive negative classes. general observed followings overall approach achieved highest performance {ff} terms metrics. however perform well using solely i.e. clearly demonstrates feature space used co-training best method. next best methods supervised learners gaussian three remarks made here. first approach could always defeat supervised learners seen tables surprising fact lies inherent diﬀerence semi-supervised supervised methods– unlabeled examples could make trained model susceptible error propagation thus wrong estimation. second seen tables achieving high recall negative examples score positive ones shall treated potent property otherwise trivial classiﬁer always assigns negative labels samples would best learner. third using always improves performance point needs clariﬁed ultimate goal achieve high performance labeled data rather detect suspicious advertisements could human traﬃcking related– explained details compared semi-supervised approaches approach either achieved higher comparable scores. reason performed exactly laplacian setting approaches inherently same. laplacian able laplacian constructed using inherently supposed made using essentially associated corresponds correspondingly holds {ff} need construct feature space concatenating laplacian inherently all. feature space used construct laplacian corresponding feature spaces baselines make better unlabeled examples. following control experiment conducted. learner tested whole unlabeled examples. instances approach identiﬁed sets positive negative instances. positive contained advertisements likely interest enforcement whereas negative included remaining unlabeled advertisements probably less interest enforcement. next precisely determine correctly identiﬁed fractions sets randomly picked subsets examples validation expert. passed control groups expert veriﬁcation. expert-validated results demonstrated examples positive group interest enforcement examples negative group correctly classiﬁed interest enforcement. thus results support eﬀectiveness framework identifying highly human traﬃcking advertisements. using control groups metric perform so-called blind evaluation baselines. note call blind since actual labels provided expert-generated labels might convey uninformative information. general supervised methods failed achieve good results blind evaluation compared semi-supervised methods. made following observation. slight increase performance approach increased peaked stabilized i.e. increase change performance. suggests signiﬁcance deploying additional information ﬁrst feature space corresponding smoothness penalty parameter used standard laplacian svm. results depicted figure note setting meaningless thus performance corresponding that– otherwise would zero. general performance particular sensitive parameter– varying values greater. list noticed ‘countries interest’ ‘reference massage therapy’ discriminative feature groups ‘advertisement language pattern’ group appeared dominant feature group. figure compares features less important subset ﬁltered dataset terms frequency values. note clarity removed ﬁgure features frequency less according ﬁgure discriminative features necessarily appear often. readily available online data escort advertisements could leveraged favor ﬁght human traﬃcking. study focused textual information
