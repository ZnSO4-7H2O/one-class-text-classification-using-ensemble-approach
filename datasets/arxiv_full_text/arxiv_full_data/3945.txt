{"title": "Overcoming Hierarchical Difficulty by Hill-Climbing the Building Block  Structure", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "G.1.6; I.2.8"], "abstract": "The Building Block Hypothesis suggests that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are well-suited for hierarchical problems, where efficient solving requires proper problem decomposition and assembly of solution from sub-solution with strong non-linear interdependencies. The paper proposes a hill-climber operating over the building block (BB) space that can efficiently address hierarchical problems. The new Building Block Hill-Climber (BBHC) uses past hill-climb experience to extract BB information and adapts its neighborhood structure accordingly. The perpetual adaptation of the neighborhood structure allows the method to climb the hierarchical structure solving successively the hierarchical levels. It is expected that for fully non deceptive hierarchical BB structures the BBHC can solve hierarchical problems in linearithmic time. Empirical results confirm that the proposed method scales almost linearly with the problem size thus clearly outperforms population based recombinative methods.", "text": "albeit widely used justify claims remains controversial situations provides good explanation works also cases like uniform crossover performing well certain test suits current form provide much useful insight. early systematic program initiated mitchell address issues concerning fundamentals gas. strategy find features particular relevance test performance landscapes containing features. recognized major tenets behind notion problem decomposition assembly solutions sub-solutions. subsequently constructed functions clearly emphasize gross-scale structure low-order recombine higher-order ones. functions expected royal road hill-climbers anticipated perform poorly large number positions must optimized simultaneously discover higher-order bbs. much surprise expectation refuted test suits performed worse expected hitchhiking phenomena random mutation hill-climber accepts states equal objective function value greatly outperformed gas. inspired fact many real-world systems hierarchical watson proposed class hierarchically decomposable functions present strong non-linear hierarchical interdependency. class function hard mutation based hill-climbers hamming distance local optima global optima large. considered class functions exemplifies problems well-suited. objective paper develop hill-climber solve hierarchical problems. proposed method operates rather bits uses past experience learn linkages adapting neighborhood structure. neighborhood structure adaptation allows hill-climber hierarchically decompose problems revealing hierarchical levels other;
