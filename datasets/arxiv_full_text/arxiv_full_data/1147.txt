{"title": "Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to House Numbers Digit  Classification", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "We classify digits of real-world house numbers using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). ConvNets are hierarchical feature learning neural networks whose structure is biologically inspired. Unlike many popular vision approaches that are hand-designed, ConvNets can automatically learn a unique set of features optimized for a given task. We augmented the traditional ConvNet architecture by learning multi-stage features and by using Lp pooling and establish a new state-of-the-art of 94.85% accuracy on the SVHN dataset (45.2% error improvement). Furthermore, we analyze the benefits of different pooling methods and multi-stage features in ConvNets. The source code and a tutorial are available at eblearn.sf.net.", "text": "classify digits real-world house numbers using convolutional neural networks convnets hierarchical feature learning neural
