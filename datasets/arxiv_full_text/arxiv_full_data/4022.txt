This naturally extends classical data analysis tools based on spectral geometry, such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering. We provide several synthetic and real examples of manifold learning, retrieval, and clustering demonstrating that the joint diffusion geometry frequently better captures the inherent structure of multi-modal data. We also show that many previous attempts to construct multimodal spectral clustering can be seen as particular cases of joint approximate diagonalization of the Laplacians.", "text": "construct extension diffusion geometry multiple modalities joint approximate diagonalization laplacian matrices. naturally extends classical data analysis tools based spectral geometry diffusion maps spectral clustering. provide several synthetic real examples manifold learning retrieval clustering demonstrating joint diffusion geometry frequently better captures inherent structure multi-modal data. also show many previous attempts construct multimodal spectral clustering seen particular cases joint approximate diagonalization laplacians. laplacian operator related constructions play pivotal role wide range applications machine learning pattern recognition computer vision community. shown many problems ﬁelds boil ﬁnding eigenvectors eigenvalues laplacian constructed high-dimensional data. important examples include spectral clustering clusters determined ﬁrst eigenvectors laplacian;
