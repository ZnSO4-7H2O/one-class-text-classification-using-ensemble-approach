{"title": "Gabor Filter and Rough Clustering Based Edge Detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper introduces an efficient edge detection method based on Gabor filter and rough clustering. The input image is smoothed by Gabor function, and the concept of rough clustering is used to focus on edge detection with soft computational approach. Hysteresis thresholding is used to get the actual output, i.e. edges of the input image. To show the effectiveness, the proposed technique is compared with some other edge detection methods.", "text": "abstract—this paper introduces efficient edge detection method based gabor filter rough clustering. input image smoothed gabor function concept rough clustering used focus edge detection soft computational approach. hysteresis thresholding used actual output i.e. edges input image. show effectiveness proposed technique compared edge detection methods. edge detection becomes challenging issue regarding image segmentation) last three decades. process identify border-line boundary pair objects/regions. sufficient number computer vision pattern recognition techniques dependent edge detection priori stage. accurate efficient edge-detector increases performance different applications related image processing pattern recognition machine vision problems e.g. object-based coding image segmentation image retrieval etc. edge detection problem viewed clustering process task classify data sets edge non-edge. patterns ‘within cluster’ ‘between clusters’ homogeneous heterogeneous respectively. gabor filter used smooth image. rough clustering rough pawlak’s accuracy used modify production nonmaximasuppressed image hysteresis thresholding used produce final output image detected edges. gabor filter linear filter whose impulse response multiplication harmonic function gaussian function convolution theorem convolution fourier transformation harmonic function gaussian function nothing gabor filter's impulse response rough theory assumption granted i.e. information related every entry data matrix. over-all information expresses completely available object-knowledge. precisely information system pair tuples non-empty finite object called universe a={a…aj} nontep thinning non-maxima suppression modified rough-clusting based pawlak’s accuracy denotes four basic edge directions region centred eightconnected neighbours. main thing rough equivalence objects equivalence relation formed knowledge-based objects information system. partitions build subsets. information system ough clustering extension rough sets containing additional requirements ordered attribute value distance measurement like standard clustering techniques distance measurement done ordering value clusters generated distance measure. proposed technique tested different images produces stable noiseless fairly good results every case assesses high robustness technique. performance proposed method compared classical edge detection techniques methods reported papers even though method produces better results fails image-shadow elimination next venture definitely overcome limitation genetic algorithm make system efficient. would like heartily thank prof. bidyut chaudhuri ieee fellow head computer vision pattern recognition unit indian statistical institute kolkata india discussion various aspects research field. marques chen border detection remote sensing satellite data using self-organizing maps centria department information university lisbon caparica portugal home page http//centria.di.fct.unl.pt/˜nmm dutta chaudhuri statistics local homogeneity based color edge detection algorithm proc. international conference advances recent technologies communication computing pp.- muthukrishnan. radha edge detection techniques image segmentation journal computer science information technology pp.- dec. adak rough clustering based unsupervised image change litian tadashi shibata unsupervised object extraction contour delineation texture based discrimination proc. eusipco- bucharest romania issn- pp.- august zhang zhong review image segmentation techniques remote sensing perspective wagner székely isprs symposium years isprs vienna austria iaprs vol. xxxviii part pp.- july senthilkumaran rajesh edge detection techniques image segmentation survey soft computing approaches international journal recent trends engineering vol. simone marinai survey document image retrieval digital libraries dipartimento sistemi informatica university florence italy marinaidsi.unifi.it hung purnawan b.c. multispectal image classification using rough theory particle swam optimization advances geoscience remote sensing intech isbn ---- pp.- october rolando estrada carlo tomasi manuscript bleed-through removal hysteresis thresholding proc. international conference document analysis recognition pp.- daugman uncertainty relation resolution space spatial frequency orientation optimized two-dimensional visual cortical filters journal optical society america july", "year": 2014}
