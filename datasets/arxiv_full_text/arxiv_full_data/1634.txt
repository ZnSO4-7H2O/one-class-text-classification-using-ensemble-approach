{"title": "A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We introduce the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), a large corpus for sarcasm research and for training and evaluating systems for sarcasm detection. The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements -- 10 times more than any previous dataset -- and many times more instances of non-sarcastic statements, allowing for learning in regimes of both balanced and unbalanced labels. Each statement is furthermore self-annotated -- sarcasm is labeled by the author and not an independent annotator -- and provided with user, topic, and conversation context. We evaluate the corpus for accuracy, compare it to previous related corpora, and provide baselines for the task of sarcasm detection.", "text": "introduce self-annotated reddit corpus large corpus sarcasm research training evaluating systems sarcasm detection. corpus million sarcastic statements times previous dataset many times instances non-sarcastic statements allowing learning balanced unbalanced label regimes. statement furthermore self-annotated sarcasm labeled author independent annotator provided user topic conversation context. evaluate corpus accuracy construct benchmarks sarcasm detection evaluate baseline methods. sarcasm datasets largely distinguished sources used sarcastic non-sarcastic statements amount human annotation whether dataset balanced unbalanced. reddit used before notably wallace authors allow unabalanced labeling exploit possibility using self-annotation generate around human-labeled sentences. twitter frequent source self-annotation provided hashtags sarcasm notsarcasm irony discussed section quality language properties make twitter less attractive source annotated comments. however largest source data purpose large unbalanced corpora previous efforts source comments internet argument corpus scraped corpus internet discussions annotated sarcasm humans machine learning; done lukin walker oraby cases resulting around labeled statements. reddit structure annotation reddit social media site users communicate commenting submissions titled posts consisting embedded media external links and/or text posted topic-speciﬁc forums known subreddits; examples subreddits include funny pics science. users comment submissions comments resulting tree-like conversation structure comment parent comment. refer elements nodes tree reddit link reddit users adopted common method sarcasm annotation consisting adding marker sarcastic statements; originates html text delineation <sarcasm>...</sarcasm> twitter hashtags using markers indicators sarcasm noisy especially since many users make marker know sarcasm detection important component many natural language processing systems directly relevant natural language understanding dialogue systems text mining. however detecting sarcasm difﬁcult because occurs infrequently difﬁcult even humans discern despite properties existing datasets either balanced labels data roughly number examples label humans annotate sarcastic statements work make available ﬁrst corpus sarcasm detection unbalanced self-annotated labels consist low-quality text snippets twitter. million examples sarcastic statements provided author topic contex information dataset exceeds previous sarcasm corpora order magnitude. possible comment structure social media site reddit well frequently-used standardized annotation sarcasm. following discussion corpus construction relevant statistics section discuss quality dataset compared alternative sources section manually evaluating corpus noise. section dataset construct suitable benchmarks sarcasm detection systems examine performance simple baseline methods human evaluators subsets. since main contribution corpus method sarcasm detection point reader recent survey joshi discusses many interesting efforts area. note many works authors mention discussed section many papers using datasets; illustrates need common baselines evaluation. table sarc compared previous sarcasm corpora. addition million sarcastic comments dataset also provides many millions non-sarcastic statements authors. detection systems. benchmarks whether balanced unbalanced regimes require subsampling corpus approach dealing noisy data face sparse signals. specify evaluate approach section followed evaluation learning algorithms output. three major metrics interest evaluating corpora size proportion sarcastic nonsarcastic comments rate false positives false negatives. interest also quality text corpus applicability tasks. thus section evaluate error corpus provide comparison corpora used construct sarcasm datasets. manual evaluation investigate noisiness using reddit source self-annotated sarcasm estimate proportion false positives false negatives induced ﬁltering. done manually checking random subset comments sarc tagged sarcastic tagged non-sarcastic full access comment’s context. comment determined false positive annotation part sentence false negative comment author clearly sarcastic human rater. procedure yielded false positive rate false negative rate although false positive rate reasonable false negative rate signiﬁcant compared sarcasm proportion indicating large variation working deﬁnition sarcasm need methods handle noisy data unbalanced setting. balanced setting still fairly small amount noise. comparison sources noted before twitter common source sarcasm previous corpora; likely explicit annotation provided hashtags. however using reddit source sarcastic comments holds many research advantages. unlike reddit comments constructing sarc reddit comments december made available web-scraping construct dataset subset comments january -april comprising vast majority comments excluding noisy data earlier years. comment provide sarcasm label author subreddit appeared comment score voted users date comment identiﬁers linking back original dataset comments. reduce noise several ﬁlters remove noisy uninformative comments. many standard preprocessing steps excluding urls limiting characters ascii. handle reddit data also exclude comments descendants sarcastic comments conversation tree annotation cases extremely noisy authors agreeing disagreeing previously expressed sarcasm sarcasm often marking. corpus consists three ﬁles array format containing million comments around million sarcastic. contains comments whose authors know standard sarcasm annotation;

reddit generally used something annotation annotation referred full conversation context also much easier provide reddit shallow tree structure individual post comments. furthermore subsample twitter reddit data july determined vastly smaller percentage twitter authors make sarcasm annotation hypothesize reddit users require sarcastic annotation frequently standardized form because largely anonymous cannot rely shared context communicate sarcasm. finally reddit also beneﬁts subreddits enable featurization data exploration based explicit topic assignment. internet argument corpus also used source sarcastic comments corpus developers found examples sarcastic much nicer class proportion sarcasm detection ours. reddit data consists arbitrary conversations arguments surprising sarcasm percentage much smaller even accounting false negatives; property also makes dataset realistic. unlike reddit twitter also requires manual annotation sarcasm. direct application corpus training evaluating sarcasm detection systems. thus using corpus described section construct several useful benchmarks task classifying statements sarcastic non-sarcastic. benchmarks provide full conversation thread leading target statements learning algorithm along comment metadata. following little familiarity devoted obscure hobbies forms. thus also test human machine performance comments drawn solely politics subreddit topic evaluators sufﬁcient background information. subsample contains thousand sequences average proportion sarcastic responses methods case balanced labels simple no-context baseline method task featurize responses train logistic regression classiﬁer distinguish sarcastic non-sarcastic response separate classes. testing pick response highest probability labeled sarcastic sarcastic one. split datasets test train-test subsets report results following three approaches table bag-of-n-grams bag-of-n-grams representation consists using document’s n-gram counts features vector. test variants bag-of-words bag-of-bigrams. subsample containing subreddits features occur least times training comments. sentence embeddings given document taking elementwise word embeddings words provides simple lowdimensional document representation. dimensional glove representations trained amazon product corpus used instead common crawl semantic closeness sentiment sarcasm human human performance sarcasm detection measured giving human evaluators samples asking perform task algorithm determining statements sarcastic. full context provided ﬁnal human classiﬁer taken majority vote evaluators. results baselines baselines table perform reasonably well none match human performance either dataset. clear scope improvement machine learning methods starting context provided make better decisions sarcasm. evident table bagof-word bag-of-bigram representations perform better sentence embeddings;
