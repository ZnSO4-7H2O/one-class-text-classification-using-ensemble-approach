{"title": "Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) - A New Paradigm for Heuristic Decision  Making", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Over the last few years, more and more heuristic decision making techniques have been inspired by nature, e.g. evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimisation and simulated annealing. More recently, a novel computational intelligence technique inspired by immunology has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). This immune system inspired technique has already been useful in solving some computational problems. In this keynote, we will very briefly describe the immune system metaphors that are relevant to AIS. We will then give some illustrative real-world problems suitable for AIS use and show a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough. A comparison of AIS to other well-known algorithms and areas for future work will round this keynote off. It should be noted that as AIS is still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm template and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from the examples given here.",

processes. many details immune mechanisms processes unknown even immunologists however well-known immune system uses multi-level defence parallel sequential fashion. depending type intruder gets body immune system uses different response mechanisms either neutralize pathogenic effect destroy infected cells. detailed overview immune system found many textbooks. immune features particularly relevant keynote matching diversity distributed control. matching refers binding antibodies antigens. diversity refers fact that order achieve optimal antigen space coverage antibody diversity must encouraged. distributed control means central controller. rather immune system governed local interactions among immune cells antigens. respiratory system physiological barriers destructive enzymes stomach acids actual immune system complementary parts innate adaptive immune systems. innate immune system unchanging mechanism detects destroys certain invading organisms whilst adaptive immune system responds previously unknown foreign cells builds response remain body long period time. interest adaptive immune system composed number different agents performing different functions number different locations body. precise interaction agents still topic debate. important cells process types white blood cells called t-cells b-cells. originate bone marrow t-cells pass thymus mature circulate body blood lymphatic vessels. -cells come three types; t-helper cells essential activation bcells killer t-cells bind foreign invaders inject poisonous chemicals causing destruction suppressor t-cells inhibit action immune cells thus preventing allergic reactions autoimmune diseases. -cells responsible production secretion antibodies specific proteins bind antigen. b-cell produce particular antibody. antigen found surface invading organism binding antibody antigen signal destroy invading cell. gleaned brief explanations above mechanism work human immune system. however concentrate essential process exploited matching antigen antibody subsequently leads increased concentrations closely matched antibodies. particular negative selection mechanism ‘clonal selection’ ‘somatic hypermutation’ theories primarily used models. purpose negative selection provide tolerance self cells. deals immune system's ability detect unknown antigens whilst reacting self. generation t-cells receptors made pseudo-random genetic rearrangement process. then undergo censoring process thymus called negative selection. there t-cells react selfproteins destroyed thus bind self-proteins allowed leave thymus. matured t-cells circulate throughout body perform immunological functions protect body foreign antigens. antibody strongly matches antigen corresponding b-cell stimulated produce clones produce antibodies. mutation quite rapid often much mutation cell division allow quick response antigens. noted literature often makes distinction b-cells antibodies produce. subsumed word ‘antibody’ statements mutation antibodies common. simplicity term ‘antibody’ following sections. many features immune system including immune network theory adaptation immunological memory protection auto-immune attacks discussed here. following sections revisit important aspects concepts show modelled ‘artificial’ immune systems used solve real-world problems. first give overview typical problems believe amenable solved ais. data mining collaborative filtering clustering term broad range algorithms similarity measures obtain information usually recommendations. best-known example probably people bought also bought that feature internet company amazon. however problem domain users required rate items amenable techniques. commercial applications usually called recommender systems. canonical example film recommendation keynote. traditional items recommended treated ‘black boxes’. recommendations based purely votes users content item. preferences user usually votes item comprise user profile profiles compared order build neighbourhood. decision similarity measure used. common method compare users correlation-based measures like pearson spearman give neighbours matching score canonical example k-nearest-neighbour algorithm uses matching method select reviewers high similarity measures. votes reviewers suitably weighted used make predictions recommendations. evaluation algorithm usually centres accuracy. difference prediction recommendation prediction easier assess quantitatively recommendation natural film domain. related problem clustering data users database. particularly useful huge databases become large handle. clustering works dividing entries database groups contain people similar preferences general data similar type. anyone keeping up-to-date current affairs computing confirm numerous cases attacks made computer servers well-known companies. attacks range denial-of-service extracting credit-card details wonders haven’t installed security firewall? fact often firewall. firewall useful often essential current firewall technology insufficient detect block kinds attacks. owever ports need open internet firewall little prevent attacks. moreover even port blocked internet access stop attack inside organisation. come name suggests installed identify attacks react usually generating alert blocking unscrupulous data. main goal detect unauthorised misuse abuse computer systems system insiders external intruders. current define suspicious signatures based known intrusions probes. obvious limit type failure detecting previously unknown intrusions. contrast human immune system adaptively generates immune cells able detect previously unknown rapidly evolving harmful antigens. thus challenge emulate success natural systems protect computers. asic concepts initialisation encoding along heuristics choosing suitable encoding important algorithm’s success. similar genetic algorithms close inter-play encoding fitness function hence ought thought time. current discussion begin encoding. irst define meant ‘antigen’ ‘antibody’ context application domain. typically antigen ‘target’ e.g. data item checked intrusion user clustered made recommendation for. antibodies remainder data e.g. users database general network traffic already identified etc. sometimes ntigens antibodies represented encoded way. problems obvious representation string numbers features length equal number variables position variable identifier value actual value variable instance five variable binary problem encoding could look like this reviously mentioned data mining intrusion detection applications. would encoding look like cases? data mining consider problem recommending films. encoding represent user’s profile regards films seen much liked them. possible encoding could list numbers number represents 'vote' item. votes could binary also integers range i.e. like film like film much). intrusion detection encoding needs encapsulate essence data packet transferred e.g. example represents incoming data packet sent port scenarios wildcards like ‘any port’ also often used. simplest matching algorithms best explained using binary encoding consider strings bit-by-bit comparison first three bits identical hence could give pair matching score words computes opposite hamming distance consider pair again simple matching gives similarity score however matching quite different three matching bits connected. depending problem encoding might better worse. thus another simple matching algorithm count number continuous bits match return length longest matching similarity measure. data mining problems similarity often means ‘correlation’. take film recommendation problem example assume trying find users database similar target user whose profile trying match make recommendations. case trying measure similar users’ tastes are. easiest ways compute pearson correlation coefficient users e.g. pearson measure used compare users users number overlapping votes vote user film average vote user films previous researchit found useful introduce penalty parameter users films common reducing correlation might artificially high. outcome measure value values close mean strong agreement values near mean strong disagreement values around mean correlation. data mining point view users score either useful hence selected treatment algorithm. approach called ‘positive selection’ might coupled form mutation explained ‘clonal selection’ section above. problem domains film recommender mutation might make sense hence pure cloning used. applications domains ‘matching’ might actually beneficial hence might want eliminate items match. approach known ‘negative selection’. circumstance would negative selection algorithm suitable implementation? consider used hofmeyr forrest. solving problem defining ‘self’ i.e. trusted network company’s computers known partners etc. initialisation algorithm randomly create large number called ‘detectors’ strings. subject detectors matching algorithm compares ‘self’. matching detectors eliminated hence match selected kept eventually detectors form final used second phase algorithm continuously monitor network traffic. match found algorithm reports possible alert ‘non-self’. meaning ‘selection’ differs somewhat depending exact problem applied already briefly described concept negative clonal selection earlier. film recommender choosing suitable neighbourhood users means choosing good correlation scores hence perform ‘positive’ selection. would algorithm this? onsider empty beginning. target user encoded antigen users database possible antibodies. antigen candidate antibody time. antibodies start certain concentration value. value represents natural lifespan antibodies decreases time similar evaporation systems. antibodies sufficiently concentration removed system whereas antibodies high concentration saturate. antibody increase concentration matching antigen better match higher increase process stimulation increasing concentration also regarded ‘cloning’ thinks discrete setting. enough antibodies added system starts iterate loop suppression stimulation least antibody drops out. antibody added process repeated stabilised i.e. drop-outs certain period time. athematically step antibody’s concentration increased amount dependent matching antigen. absence matching antibody’s concentration slowly decrease time. hence iteration governed following equation example considered stable iterating times without changing size. stabilisation thus means sufficient number ‘good’ neighbours identified therefore prediction made. ‘poor’ neighbours would expected drop iterations. stabilised using algorithm antibody concentration weigh neighbours perform weighted average type recommendation. mutation commonly used similar found genetic algorithms e.g. binary strings bits flipped real value strings value changed random others order elements swapped. addition mechanism often enhanced ‘somatic’ idea i.e. closer match disruptive mutation. owever mutating data might make sense problems considered. instance would suitable film recommender. certainly mutation could used make users similar target however validity recommendations based artificial users questionable over-done could target user itself. hence problems somatic hypermutation used since immediately obvious mutate data sensibly artificial entities still represent plausible data. evertheless problem domains mutation might useful. instance taking negative selection approach intrusion detection rather throwing away matching detectors first phase algorithm could mutated save time effort. also depending degree matching mutation could less strong. fact extension implemented hofmeyr forrest. data mining problems mutation might also useful instance cluster users. centre cluster could artificial pseudo user mutated desired degree matching centre antigens cluster reached. going keynote might already noticed concepts similar genetic algorithms neural networks mentioned number times. fact number ideas common purpose following self-explanatory
