resembling learning process biological brain. based network topologies neural networks generally categorized feedforward neural networks recurrent/recursive neural networks also mixed matched. describe recurrent/recursive neural networks later. simple example feedforward neural network given figure consists three layers input layer corresponds input vector intercept term output layer

techniques applied tasks. many deep learning models need word embedding results input features. word embedding technique language modelling feature learning transforms words lower-dimensional dense vector space. dimension embedding vector represents latent feature word. vectors encode linguistic regularities patterns. learning word embeddings done using neural networks- matrix factorization. commonly used word embedding system wordveci essentially computationallyefficient neural network prediction model learns word embeddings text. contains continuous bag-of-words model skip-gram model cbow model predicts target word context words model inverse predicting context words given target word. statistically cbow model smoothens great deal distributional information treating entire context observation. effective smaller datasets. however model treats context-target pair observation better larger datasets. another frequently used learning approach global vectorii trained nonzero entries global word-word co-occurrence matrix. given input vector autoencoder first maps hidden representation encoder function latent representation mapped back decoder function reconstruction autoencoder typically trained minimize form reconstruction error 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠. hidden layer. nonlinear function autoencoder able learn nonone often stacks autoencoders layers. higher level autoencoder uses output lower training data. stacked autoencoders along restricted boltzmann machines earliest approaches building deep neural networks. stack autoencoders trained unsupervised fashion parameters describing multiple levels representations used initialize supervised deep denoising autoencoder extension autoencoder input vector stochastically corrupted vector model trained denoise minimize denoising reconstruction error 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠. idea behind force hidden layer discover robust features prevent simply learning identity. robust model able reconstruct input well even presence noises. example deleting adding words document change semantic document. convolutional neural network special type feedforward neural network originally employed field computer vision. design inspired human visual cortex visual mechanism animal brain. visual cortex contains cells responsible detecting light small overlapping sub-regions visual fields called receptive fields. cells local filters input space. consists multiple convolutional layers performs function processed cells visual cortex. figure shows recognizing traffic signs. input pixel image first stage filter used scan image. region input image filter projects receptive field. filter actually array numbers filter sliding multiplying weight values original pixel values image multiplications summed single number representative receptive field. every receptive field produces number. filter finishes scanning image array called activation feature map. need different filters scan input. figure apply kinds filters thus stacked feature maps first stage consists first convolutional layer. following convolutional layer subsampling layer usually used progressively reduce spatial size representation thus reduce number features computational complexity network. example subsampling first stage convolutional layer reduces dimensions note dimensionality feature reduced subsampling step retains important information commonly used subsampling operation pooling. afterwards output first stage becomes input second stage filters employed. filter size feature size last layer. second stage uses fully connected layer softmax readout layer output classes classification. convolutional layers play role feature extractor extracts local features restrict receptive fields hidden layers local. means special spatiallylocal correlation enforcing local connectivity pattern neurons adjacent layers. characteristic useful classification expect find strong local clues regarding class membership clues appear different places input. example document classification task single phrase help determining topic document. would like learn certain sequences words good indicators topic necessarily care appear document. convolutional pooling layers allow learn find local indicators regardless positions. recurrent neural network class neural networks whose connections neurons form directed cycle. unlike feedforward neural networks internal memory process sequence inputs makes popular processing sequential information. memory means performs task every element sequence output dependent previous computations like remembering information processed far. figure shows example rnn. left graph unfolded network cycles right graph folded sequence network three time steps. length time steps determined length input. example word sequence processed sentence words would unfolded neural network time steps layers. layer corresponds word. figure input vector time step hidden state time step ℎ=𝑓𝑤ℎ+𝑤𝑥 equation activation function usually tanh function

model bidirectional deep bidirectional long short term memory network. bidirectional based idea output time depend previous elements sequence also depend next elements sequence. instance predict missing word sequence need look left right context. bidirectional consists rnns stacked other. processes input original order processes reversed input sequence. output computed based hidden state rnns. deep bidirectional similar bidirectional rnn. difference multiple layers time step rnns form chain repeating modules. standard rnns repeating module normally simple structure. however repeating module lstm complicated. instead single neural network layer four layers interacting special way. besides states hidden state cell state. figure shows example lstm. time step lstm first decides information dump cell state. decision made sigmoid function/layer called forget gate. function takes outputs 𝑓=𝜎𝑊𝑥+𝑈ℎ update. next tanh function/layer creates vector candidate values 𝑊𝑥+𝑈ℎ =tanh𝑊𝑥+𝑈ℎ time update cell state cell state equation note forget gate control gradient passes allow explicit memory deletes finally lstm decides output based cell state. lstm first runs sigmoid layer decides parts cell state output equation called output gate. then lstm puts cell state tanh function multiplies output sigmoid gate lstm outputs parts decides equation lstm commonly applied sequential data also used tree-structured data. introduced generalization standard lstm tree-structured lstm showed better performances representing sentence meaning sequential lstm. slight variation lstm gated recurrent unit combines forget input gates single update gate. also merges cell state hidden state makes changes. resulting model simpler standard lstm model growing popularity. supposedly bidirectional lstm able deal long-range dependencies data. practice long-range dependencies still problematic handle. thus technique called attention mechanism proposed. attention mechanism neural networks inspired visual attention mechanism found humans. human visual attention able focus certain region image high resolution perceiving surrounding image resolution adjusting focal point time. attention mechanism allows model learn attend based input text produced rather encoding full source text fixed-length vector like standard lstm. bahdanau first utilized attention mechanism machine
