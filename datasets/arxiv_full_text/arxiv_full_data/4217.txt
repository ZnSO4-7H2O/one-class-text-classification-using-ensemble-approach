{"title": "Direction-Aware Semi-Dense SLAM", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "To aide simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), future perception systems will incorporate forms of scene understanding. In a step towards fully integrated probabilistic geometric scene understanding, localization and mapping we propose the first direction-aware semi-dense SLAM system. It jointly infers the directional Stata Center World (SCW) segmentation and a surfel-based semi-dense map while performing real-time camera tracking. The joint SCW map model connects a scene-wide Bayesian nonparametric Dirichlet Process von-Mises-Fisher mixture model (DP-vMF) prior on surfel orientations with the local surfel locations via a conditional random field (CRF). Camera tracking leverages the SCW segmentation to improve efficiency via guided observation selection. Results demonstrate improved SLAM accuracy and tracking efficiency at state of the art performance.", "text": "figure propose ﬁrst direction-aware semi-dense slam system. based stata center world
