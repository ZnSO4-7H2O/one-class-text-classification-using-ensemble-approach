{"title": "Identifying 3 moss species by deep learning, using the \"chopped picture\"  method", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "In general, object identification tends not to work well on ambiguous, amorphous objects such as vegetation. In this study, we developed a simple but effective approach to identify ambiguous objects and applied the method to several moss species. As a result, the model correctly classified test images with accuracy more than 90%. Using this approach will help progress in computer vision studies.", "text": "field science education research center kyoto university japan faculty agriculture kyoto university japan graduate school agriculture kyoto university japan general object identification tends work well ambiguous amorphous objects vegetation. study developed simple effective approach identify ambiguous objects applied method several moss species. result model correctly classified test images accuracy using approach help progress computer vision studies. identification however deep learning mostly applied distinctive deterministic objects human face human body automobile etc. hand ambiguous objects trees shrubs herbs suitable identification machine learning. study applied method called chopped picture identify ambiguous amorphous objects. case study mosses type green plants target objects identification. general differing animals plants characteristics modular growth. example numbers leaves stems individual typically possesses predetermined change flexibly according environmental conditions. clearly different standard model human face predetermined numbers parts eyes mouth characteristics plants make object identification difficult. tissues well differentiated thus mosses even difficult target machine learning. addition mosses tend form mats consisted numerous individuals species. behavior challenging object identification difficult distinguish individuals. willfully selected difficult target case study order test whether chopped picture method overcome difficulties. climate suitable moss growth. study site murin-an traditional japanese garden owned kyoto municipal government study selected moss genus trachycystis species hypnum species identification. addition categories another visual category moss fig. scenery murin-an garden. ground japanese garden moisture level relatively high rainfall nearby ponds sunlight moderately available sparsely planted trees. environmental conditions make garden good habitat several moss species. found monotone moss patches uniformly covered single moss species took pictures digital camera example picture showing fig. pixel size next using chopped picture small squares overlap vertically horizontally method easy obtain training data simply need digital photographs make thousands training data. used olympus om-d mark panasonic lumix mm/f. asph took photographs directly moss patches repeated protocol moss types moss category fig. photograph ground murin-an garden. almost area photograph covered hypnum species chopping large digital image small squares overlap able obtain large training dataset deep learning easily. hypnum species small fraction contamination polytrichum species. small squares impurities screened removed hand. summary training shown fig. total obtained images training used validation. used lenet network model. learning settings basically default digits image classification model test trained model selected picture also taken protocol picture target moss species non-moss objects included test model also chopped picture manner training data. using model testing function digits model gives prediction confidence prediction. organize small pieces original picture showing predicted categories colored circles result model classified moss species appropriately. bottom right picture mostly covered uniformly model nicely classified objects. growth within patch model appropriately found individuals. classification generally appropriate classification errors. obtain quantitative performance arbitrarily regions moss species dominate. regions left corner locate circles color dominated species evaluate whether model prediction correct incorrect. repeated times region calculated performance. estimated performance fig. example model performance test moss species moss categories. results classification color-coded original image obtained <https//www.dropbox.com/s/hmakjofnmdsv/clipboard.jpg>. chopped picture method good identify ambiguous objects green plants especially mosses. although mosses highly amorphous method generally performed well. excellent moss species relatively large relatively distinctive well-defined shape. hand performance good moss species highly amorphous; strongly shows vegetative growth runners. result shape patches become amorphous characteristics affected model performance. improve performance. color standardization using color chart photography allow standardize white balance exposure. trial error chopping size also performed better performance. although mosses evergreen plants still show seasonal differences color shape size. example spring growing season produces light green parts easily visible human eyes season. moreover mosses produce reproductive organs particular timings. thus collecting training data many seasons situations improve model. performance object identification deep learning applied things amorphous shapes. method applied visual observations plants various scales field photography drone photography aircraft photography google earth satellite images. addition practical application hope make application moss identifier allows people know moss names using smartphone. work part utilizing knowledge universities multilateral municipal government research project kyoto city japan also supported presto grant number jpmjpro japan. deeply appreciate professional advice drs. yoshitaka oishi wakana azuma.", "year": 2017}
