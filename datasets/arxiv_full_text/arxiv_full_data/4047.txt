{"title": "Diffusion Methods for Classification with Pairwise Relationships", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "We define two algorithms for propagating information in classification problems with pairwise relationships. The algorithms are based on contraction maps and are related to non-linear diffusion and random walks on graphs. The approach is also related to message passing algorithms, including belief propagation and mean field methods. The algorithms we describe are guaranteed to converge on graphs with arbitrary topology. Moreover they always converge to a unique fixed point, independent of initialization. We prove that the fixed points of the algorithms under consideration define lower-bounds on the energy function and the max-marginals of a Markov random field. The theoretical results also illustrate a relationship between message passing algorithms and value iteration for an infinite horizon Markov decision process. We illustrate the practical application of the algorithms under study with numerical experiments in image restoration, stereo depth estimation and binary classification on a grid.", "text": "local information modeled cost assigning label vertex information label compatibility neighboring vertices modeled cost assigning label vertex label vertex cost labeling deﬁned energy function labels. vertex non-negative cost assigning label vertex denoted costs capture local information label vertex. edge non-negative cost assigning label vertex label vertex denoted equally hji. costs capture relationships labels neighboring vertices. section study ﬁxed point iteration algorithm deﬁned relationship approximates justiﬁes selecting labeling minimizing vertex. approach related mean ﬁeld methods variational inference gibbs distribution section study algorithm deﬁned relationship extent approximates justiﬁes selecting labeling minimizing vertex. also show connection ﬁxed point optimal policies figure ﬁxed points problems deﬁned graph above. case cases local costs zero except vertex preference towards label pairwise costs encourage neighboring vertices take label. pairwise weights deﬁnition deﬁne random process generates random walks markov chain state space starting vertex generate inﬁnite sequence random vertices transition probabilities feasible solution linear constraints equivalent since preserves order follows induction since sequence converges pointwise non-decreasing conclude actions discount factor cost function speciﬁes cost taking action state transition probabilities specify probability moving state take action state similar weak membrane model local costs penalize diﬀerences pairwise costs penalize diﬀerences neighboring pixels setting graph grid vertices correspond pixels practice consider problem labeling every pixel integer disparity case labeling disparity local costs encourage pixels matched pixels similar color pairwise costs encourage piecewise smooth disparity maps.", "year": 2015}
