abilities of multimodal deep learning models in detail.", "text": "discuss problems standard approaches evaluation tasks like visual question answering argue artiﬁcial data used address complement

mikolov babi tasks focus problem visually grounded language understanding context recently popular task visual question answering principle task particularly interesting semantic perspective since combines general language understanding reference resolution grounded language reasoning simple clear task. however recent work suggested popular datasets inadequate various issues allow evaluated
