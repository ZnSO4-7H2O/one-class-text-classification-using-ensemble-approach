{"title": "Acquiring Lexical Paraphrases from a Single Corpus", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "I.7"], "abstract": "This paper studies the potential of identifying lexical paraphrases within a single corpus, focusing on the extraction of verb paraphrases. Most previous approaches detect individual paraphrase instances within a pair (or set) of comparable corpora, each of them containing roughly the same information, and rely on the substantial level of correspondence of such corpora. We present a novel method that successfully detects isolated paraphrase instances within a single corpus without relying on any a-priori structure and information. A comparison suggests that an instance-based approach may be combined with a vector based approach in order to assess better the paraphrase likelihood for many verb pairs.", "text": "paper studies

growing attention. broadly speaking paraphrases capture core aspects variability language representing equivalencies different expressions correspond meaning. representing tracking language variability many applications example question might certain words expressions answer found corpus might include paraphrases expressions another example multidocument summarization case system deduce different expressions found several documents express meaning; hence included final summary. recently several works addressed task acquiring paraphrases automatically corpora. attempts based identifying corresponding sentences parallel comparable corpora corpus known include texts largely correspond texts another corpus major types comparable corpora different translations text multiple news sources overlap largely stories cover. typically methods first identify pairs larger contexts correspond other corresponding documents using clustering similarity measures document level utilizing external information requiring corresponding documents date. then within corresponding contexts algorithm detects individual pairs sentences largely overlap content thus assumed describe

propose different approach extracting inference rules largely correspond paraphrase patterns. method extracts paraphrases single corpus rather comparable corpora. based vector-based similarity compares typical contexts global manner rather identifying actual paraphrase instances describe fact event. goal research explore potential learning paraphrases within single corpus. clearly requiring pair comparable corpora disadvantage since corpora exist domains substantially harder assemble. hand approach detecting actual paraphrase instances previously achieved within comparable corpora seems high potential extracting reliable paraphrase patterns. therefore developed method detects concrete paraphrase instances within single corpus. paraphrase instances found since coherent domain corpus likely include repeated references concrete facts events even though might found within generally different stories first version algorithm restricted identify lexical paraphrases verbs order study whether approach whole feasible. challenge addressed algorithm identify isolated paraphrase instances describe fact within single corpus. paraphrase instances need distinguished instances distinct facts described similar terms. goals achieved combination statistical linguistic filters probabilistically motivated paraphrase likelihood measure. found algorithmic computation needed detecting local paraphrase instances across single corpus quite different previous methods developed comparable corpora largely relied a-priori knowledge correspondence different stories paraphrase instances extracted. compared method vector-based approach measures global similarity across instances. precision methods common verbs comparable exhibit different behaviors. particular instance-based approach

verb instance pairs. following vein previous section estimate joint probability different instance pairs occurred chance. assuming instance independence would like multiply overlap probabilities obtained instances. found though verb instance pairs whose verbs share subject object independent avoid complex modeling dependencies picked verb instance pair subject-object combination taking lowest probability yields best scoring instances distinct subject object components. assuming independence occurrence probability instances probability p)=π calculated equation above. score verb type pair

sentence overlap specified threshold filtered out. additional assumption events unique propositional representation hence verb instances contradicting vectors likely describe event. therefore filter verb instance pairs contradicting propositional information common syntactic relation different arguments. example sentence iraqi forces captured kurdish rebels august contradicting ‘on’ preposition
