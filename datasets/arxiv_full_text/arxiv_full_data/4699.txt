{"title": "Beyond One-Step-Ahead Forecasting: Evaluation of Alternative  Multi-Step-Ahead Forecasting Models for Crude Oil Prices", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "An accurate prediction of crude oil prices over long future horizons is challenging and of great interest to governments, enterprises, and investors. This paper proposes a revised hybrid model built upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on the feed-forward neural network (FNN) modeling framework incorporating the slope-based method (SBM), which is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of crude oil prices. Three commonly used multi-step-ahead prediction strategies proposed in the literature, including iterated strategy, direct strategy, and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) strategy, are examined and compared, and practical considerations for the selection of a prediction strategy for multi-step-ahead forecasting relating to crude oil prices are identified. The weekly data from the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil spot price are used to compare the performance of the alternative models under the EMD-SBM-FNN modeling framework with selected counterparts. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of prediction accuracy and computational cost. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed EMD-SBM-FNN model using the MIMO strategy is the best in terms of prediction accuracy with accredited computational load.", "text": "andrawis r.r. atiya a.f. el-shishiny forecast combinations computational intelligence linear models time series forecasting competition. forecasting. atiya a.f. el-shoura s.m. shaheen s.i. el-sherif m.s. comparison neural-network forecasting techniques-case study river flow forecasting. neural networks ieee transactions azadeh moghaddam khakzad ebrahimipour flexible neural network-fuzzy mathematical programming algorithm improvement price estimation forecasting. comput eng. taieb bontempi sorjamaa lendasse long-term prediction time series combining direct mimo strategies. neural networks ijcnn international joint conference ieee; taieb bontempi sorjamaa lendasse long-term prediction time series combining direct mimo strategies. international joint conference neural networks ijcnn ieee; taieb bontempi atiya a.f. sorjamaa review comparison strategies multi-step ahead time series forecasting based forecasting competition. expert syst appl. bontempi long term time series prediction multi-input multi-output local learning. proceedings european symposium time series prediction estsp. helsinki finland-. brockwell p.j. davis r.a. introduction time series forecasting york springer. cadenas rivera short term wind speed forecasting venta oaxaca méxico using chevillon direct multi-step estimation forecasting. econ surveys. d.r. prediction exponentially weighted moving averages related methods. journal crone s.f. nikolopoulos hibon automatic modelling forecasting artificial neural networks–a forecasting competition evaluation. iif/sas grant research report. short-term energy outlook september website http//wwweiagov/forecasts/steo/. el-sebakhy e.a. forecasting properties crude systems based support vector wang tang wang novel seasonal decomposition based least squares support vector regression ensemble learning approach hydropower consumption forecasting china. energy. ouenniche data envelopment analysis-based framework relative performance evaluation competing crude prices’ volatility forecasting models. energy econ. hybrid model based kalman filtering weather prediction model generalized pattern matching based genetic algorithm hybrid model based electricity load emd-nns forecasting models based vector error correction mechanism transfer function framework decomposition neural networks multilayer perceptron algorithm arima-nns arima-kalman som-svm-pso lssvm hybrid method based wavelet transform combined arima", "year": 2014}
