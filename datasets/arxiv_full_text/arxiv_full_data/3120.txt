{"title": "A Multiscale Framework for Challenging Discrete Optimization", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art discrete optimization methods struggle behind when it comes to challenging contrast-enhancing discrete energies (i.e., favoring different labels for neighboring variables). This work suggests a multiscale approach for these challenging problems. Deriving an algebraic representation allows us to coarsen any pair-wise energy using any interpolation in a principled algebraic manner. Furthermore, we propose an energy-aware interpolation operator that efficiently exposes the multiscale landscape of the energy yielding an effective coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. Results on challenging contrast-enhancing energies show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.", "text": "current state-of-the-art discrete optimization methods struggle behind comes challenging contrast-enhancing discrete energies work suggests multiscale approach challenging problems. deriving algebraic representation allows coarsen pair-wise energy using interpolation principled algebraic manner. furthermore propose energy-aware interpolation operator efﬁciently exposes multiscale landscape energy yielding effective coarse-to-ﬁne optimization scheme. results challenging contrast-enhancing energies show signiﬁcant improvement state-of-the-art methods. variables edges. sought solution discrete vector variables taking possible labels minimizing energy instances form considered literature smoothness preserving assigning neighboring variables label costs less energy. smoothness preserving energies include submodular metric semi-metric energies. state-of-the-art optimization algorithms large move dual decomposition handle smoothness preserving energies well yielding close optimal results. however comes contrastenhancing energies existing algorithms provide poor approximations contrast-enhancing energies relaxation longer tight therefore converge optimal solution. work suggests multiscale approach optimization contrast-enhancing energies. coarse-to-ﬁne exploration solution space allows effectively avoid getting stuck local minima. work makes major contributions algebraic representation energy allows principled derivation coarse scale energy using linear coarse-to-ﬁne interpolation. energy-aware method computing interpolation operator efﬁciently exposes multiscale landscape energy. multiscale approaches discrete optimization proposed past however focus mainly accelerating optimization process smoothness preserving energies. furthermore methods usually restricted diadic coarsening grid-based energies suggest ad-hoc heuristic derivation coarse-scale energy contrast framework suggests principled derivation coarse scale energy using novel energy-aware interpolation yielding energy solutions. algebraic representation requires substitution vector equivalent binary matrix representation }n×l. rows correspond variables columns corresponds labels variable labeled expressing energy using yields quadratic representation generated coarse energy parameterized approximates energy coarse energy form original energy allowing apply coarsening procedure recursively construct energy pyramid. principled algebraic representation allows perform label coarsening similar manner. looking different interpolation matrix interpolate coarse solution time interpolation matrix acts labels i.e. columns coarse labeling matrix number rows fewer columns coarsening labels yields equations encapsulate contributions constructing energy pyramid depends interpolation straightforward derive coarse-scale energy principled manner. appropriate interpolation?
