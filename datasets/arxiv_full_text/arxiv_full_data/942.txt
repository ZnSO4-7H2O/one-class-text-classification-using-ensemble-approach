{"title": "A mathematical motivation for complex-valued convolutional networks", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "A complex-valued convolutional network (convnet) implements the repeated application of the following composition of three operations, recursively applying the composition to an input vector of nonnegative real numbers: (1) convolution with complex-valued vectors followed by (2) taking the absolute value of every entry of the resulting vectors followed by (3) local averaging. For processing real-valued random vectors, complex-valued convnets can be viewed as \"data-driven multiscale windowed power spectra,\" \"data-driven multiscale windowed absolute spectra,\" \"data-driven multiwavelet absolute values,\" or (in their most general configuration) \"data-driven nonlinear multiwavelet packets.\" Indeed, complex-valued convnets can calculate multiscale windowed spectra when the convnet filters are windowed complex-valued exponentials. Standard real-valued convnets, using rectified linear units (ReLUs), sigmoidal (for example, logistic or tanh) nonlinearities, max. pooling, etc., do not obviously exhibit the same exact correspondence with data-driven wavelets (whereas for complex-valued convnets, the correspondence is much more than just a vague analogy). Courtesy of the exact correspondence, the remarkably rich and rigorous body of mathematical analysis for wavelets applies directly to (complex-valued) convnets.", "text": "abstract complex-valued convolutional network implements repeated application following composition three operations recursively applying composition input vector nonnegative real numbers convolution complex-valued vectors followed taking absolute value every entry resulting vectors followed local averaging. processing real-valued random vectors complex-valued convnets viewed data-driven multiscale windowed power spectra data-driven multiscale windowed absolute spectra datadriven multiwavelet absolute values data-driven nonlinear multiwavelet packets. indeed complex-valued convnets calculate multiscale windowed spectra convnet ﬁlters windowed complex-valued exponentials. standard real-valued convnets using rectiﬁed linear units sigmoidal nonlinearities max. pooling etc. obviously exhibit exact correspondence data-driven wavelets courtesy exact correspondence remarkably rich rigorous body mathematical analysis wavelets applies directly convnets. convolutional networks become increasingly important artiﬁcial intelligence recent years reviewed lecun present paper presents theoretical argument complex-valued convnets remarkable performance;
