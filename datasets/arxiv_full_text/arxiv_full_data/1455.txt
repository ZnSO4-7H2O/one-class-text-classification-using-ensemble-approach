{"title": "SemEval 2017 Task 10: ScienceIE - Extracting Keyphrases and Relations  from Scientific Publications", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We describe the SemEval task of extracting keyphrases and relations between them from scientific documents, which is crucial for understanding which publications describe which processes, tasks and materials. Although this was a new task, we had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for researchers working on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader knowledge base population and information extraction communities.", "text": "describe semeval task extracting keyphrases relations scientiﬁc documents crucial understanding publications describe processes tasks materials. although task total submissions across evaluation scenarios. expect task ﬁndings reported paper relevant researchers working understanding scientiﬁc content well broader knowledge base population information extraction communities. empirical research requires gaining maintaining understanding body work speciﬁc area. example typical questions researchers face papers describe tasks processes materials relate another. review papers areas information generally difﬁcult obtain without reading large number publications. task tackled mention-level identiﬁcation classiﬁcation keyphrases e.g. keyphrase extraction well extracting semantic relations keywords e.g. keyphrase extraction hyponym-of information extraction. tasks related tasks named entity recognition named entity classiﬁcation relation extraction. however keyphrases much challenging identify e.g. person names since vary signiﬁcantly domains lack clear signiﬁers contexts consist many tokens. purpose double-annotated corpus publications mention-level annotations produced consisting scientiﬁc articles computer science material sciences physics domains. extracting keyphrases relations great interest scientiﬁc publishers helps recommend articles readers highlight missing citations authors identify potential reviewers submissions analyse research trends time. note organising keyphrases terms synonym hypernym relations particularly useful search scenarios e.g. reader search articles information extraction hypernym prediction would also receive articles named entity recognition relation extraction. expect outcomes task relevant wider information extraction knowledge base population knowledge base construction communities offers novel application domain methods researched area still offering domain-related challenges. since dataset annotated three tasks dependent another could also used testbed joint learning structured prediction approaches information extraction furthermore expect task interesting researchers studying tasks aiming understanding scientiﬁc content keyphrase extraction semantic relation extraction subtask information extraction using conditional random ﬁelds method evaluated conll- corpus. expected impact task interest mentioned research communities beyond task release corpus leading novel research methods information extraction scientiﬁc documents. particularly useful proposed corpus annotations hypernym synonym relations mention-level existing hypernym synonym relation resources type-level e.g. wordnet. further expect methods directly impact industrial solutions making sense publications

metadata. paragraphs journal articles evenly distributed among domains computer science material sciences physics selected. training data part corpus consists documents development testing. similar pilot task described section articles used training development testing. present statistics dataset table notably dataset contains many long keyphrases. keyphrases training consist words tokens. contributes making task keyphrase identiﬁcation challenging. however keyphrases noun phrases valuable information simple heuristics identify keyphrase candidates. lastly keyphrases contained training dataset appear once systems generalise unseen keyphrases well. mention-level annotation time-consuming handful semantic relations hypernymy synonymy found publication. therefore annotate paragraphs publications likely contain relations. originally intended identify suitable documents automatically extracting knowledge graph relations large scientiﬁc dataset using hearst-style patterns using potential relations distinct documents similar distant supervision heuristic. documents containing high number potential relations would selected. however requires automatically learning identify keyphrases potential relations hold requires relations appear several times dataset knowledge graph useful. strategy feasible difﬁculty learning detect keyphrases automatically small overlap relations different documents. instead keyphrasedense paragraphs detected automatically using coarse unsupervised approach likely contain relations selected manually annotation. dent newsletter reaches students. students shown example annotations annotation guidelines still interested participating annotation exercise afterwards asked select beforehand many documents wanted annotate. approximately students still interested having seen annotated documents read annotation guidelines. given weeks annotate documents brat tool hosted amazon instance service. students compensated annotations

annotation cost covered elsevier. develop annotation guidelines small pilot annotation exercise documents performed annotator annotation guidelines reﬁned. originally intended student annotators triple annotate documents apply majority voting annotations difﬁculties recruiting high-quality annotators instead opted double-annotate documents second annotator expert annotator. annotations disagreed opted expert’s annotation. pairwise inter-annotator agreement student annotator expert annotator measured cohen’s kappa shown table indicates annotation quality decreased time ending annotator completing annotating documents. account this documents annotations given excluded computing inter-annotator agreement. annotators completing annotation exercise cohen’s kappa ranges half substantial agreement higher. future iterations task recommend invest signiﬁcant efforts recruiting high-quality annotators perhaps pre-annotation quality screening. characteristic material process
