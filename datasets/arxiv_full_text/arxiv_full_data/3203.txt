To this end, many algorithms have been developed to classify multi-label data in an effective manner. However, they usually do not consider the pairwise relations indicated by sample labels, which actually play important roles in multi-label classification. Inspired by this, we naturally extend the traditional pairwise constraints to the multi-label scenario via a flexible thresholding scheme. Moreover, to improve the generalization ability of the classifier, we adopt a boosting-like strategy to construct a multi-label ensemble from a group of base classifiers. To achieve these goals, this paper presents a novel multi-label classification framework named Variable Pairwise Constraint projection for Multi-label Ensemble (VPCME). Specifically, we take advantage of the variable pairwise constraint projection to learn a lower-dimensional data representation, which preserves the correlations between samples and labels. Thereafter, the base classifiers are trained in the new data space. For the boosting-like strategy, we employ both the variable pairwise constraints and the bootstrap steps to diversify the base classifiers. Empirical studies have shown the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with other approaches.", "text": "multi-label classification attracted increasing amount attention recent years. many

problem since problems type ubiquitous great number multi-label classification methods continuously developed deal multi-label data broad range areas. general existing multi-label classification techniques divided groups problem transformation algorithm adaptation. former aims transform multi-label problem several single-label problems e.g. binary relevance label power-set latter attempts generalize existing single-label classification algorithms multi-label cases e.g. boostexter learns binary classifiers different label regards unique labels class single-label classification task. zhang proposed multi-label k-nearest neighbor method implements single classifier combination bayesian inference. actually applied many practical tasks promising results well simplicity. since

member ensemble constructs label power-set classifier using small random subset. furthermore read forward pruned sets method focuses important label correlations proposed classifier chains model label correlations tolerable computational complexity section introduce proposed vpcme framework. first give explicit definition variable pairwise constraints. second inherent components multi-label classification framework described i.e. variable pairwise constraint projection boosting-like strategy. finally summarize algorithm. pairwise constraints often used characterize relations among labels many tasks semi-supervised clustering traditional pairwise constraints exclusively utilized single-label problem none works applied concept multi-label problem best knowledge. work explore multi-label pairwise constraints discover latent relations among multiple labels. achieve goal propose concept called variable pairwise constraints extension traditional ones. details shown follows. recall traditional pairwise constraints single-label problem generally defined follows sample pair shares identical label impose must-link constraint them; otherwise impose cannot-link constraint them. constraints called fixed pairwise constraints. however comes multi-label problem fixed constraints become improper sense strict constraints lead serious unbalances must-link cannot-link constraints. worse still constraints fixed might impossible diversify base classifiers. matter fact shortcomings would bring many inconveniences regard succeeding tasks e.g. constraint projection multi-label classification. therefore natural extend traditional pairwise constraint multi-label scenarios i.e. variable pairwise constraints. since multi-label data related multiple labels give intuitive definition percentage labels sample pair larger equal threshold sample pair imposed must-link constraint; otherwise cannot-link constraint. reality sample pairs must-link constraints form must-link sample pairs cannot-link constraints form cannot-link set. hopefully performance multi-label classification algorithms could improved taking account inherent correlations among multiple labels. framework label correlations reflected terms variable pairwise constraints. concretely must-link collects sample pairs similar labels re-sampling process. meanwhile cannot-link collects sample pairs
