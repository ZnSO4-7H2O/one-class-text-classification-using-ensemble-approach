{"title": "Learning to Predict Combinatorial Structures", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "The major challenge in designing a discriminative learning algorithm for predicting structured data is to address the computational issues arising from the exponential size of the output space. Existing algorithms make different assumptions to ensure efficient, polynomial time estimation of model parameters. For several combinatorial structures, including cycles, partially ordered sets, permutations and other graph classes, these assumptions do not hold. In this thesis, we address the problem of designing learning algorithms for predicting combinatorial structures by introducing two new assumptions: (i) The first assumption is that a particular counting problem can be solved efficiently. The consequence is a generalisation of the classical ridge regression for structured prediction. (ii) The second assumption is that a particular sampling problem can be solved efficiently. The consequence is a new technique for designing and analysing probabilistic structured prediction models. These results can be applied to solve several complex learning problems including but not limited to multi-label classification, multi-category hierarchical classification, and label ranking.", "text": "major challenge designing discriminative learning algorithm predicting structured data address computational issues arising exponential size output space. existing algorithms make diﬀerent assumptions ensure eﬃcient polynomial time estimation model parameters. several combinatorial structures including cycles partially ordered sets permutations graph classes assumptions hold. thesis address problem designing learning algorithms predicting combinatorial structures introducing assumptions second assumption particular sampling problem solved eﬃciently. consequence technique designing analysing probabilistic structured prediction models. results applied solve several complex learning problems including limited multi-label classiﬁcation multi-category hierarchical classiﬁcation label ranking. thomas g¨artner continual advice introducing graph theory kernel methods teaching write technical papers numerous discussions topics related machine learning carefully reading drafts manuscript suggesting improvements. ridge regression training combinatorial structures scalability issues linear models online optimisation approximate inference approximate decoding approximate enumeration empirical results summary probabilistic models exponential families hardness computing partition function approximating partition function using uniform samplers approximating partition function using counting for-", "year": 2009}
