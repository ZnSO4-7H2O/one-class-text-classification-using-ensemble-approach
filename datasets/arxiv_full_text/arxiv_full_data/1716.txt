Semantically enriched syntactic tags assigned to the target-language training texts improved translation quality. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English translation task. This finding supports the hypothesis (posed by many researchers in the MT community, e.g., in DARPA GALE) that both syntactic and semantic information are critical for improving translation quality---and further demonstrates that large gains can be achieved for low-resource languages with different word order than English.", "text": "model translating urdu english. resulting system

syntactic enrichments hiero model demonstrating success integration semantic aspects language bodes well future improvements based incorporation semantic aspects e.g. relations temporal knowledge translation rules would improve translations. syntactic framework unique ability support exploration impact many different types semantics quality. ﬁndings indicate syntactic semantic information radically improves translation quality low-resource languages different word order english. urdu word order compared english thus observed improvements likely transferable languages like korean farsi well host lowresource languages different word order. work presented represents ﬁrst small steps toward full integration semantics. efforts underway darpa’s gale program already demonstrated potential combining semantics answer information needs monolingual speakers using multilingual sources. previous work however semantic processing proceeded largely independently system operating translated output. approach signiﬁcantly different combines syntax semantics single model offering potential advantages joint modeling joint decision-making. would interesting explore whether integration syntax semantics extended provide single-model solution tasks cross-language information extraction question answering evaluate integrated approach e.g. using gale distillation metrics. acknowledgments thank
