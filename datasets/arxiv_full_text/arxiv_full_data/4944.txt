{"title": "PPMF: A Patient-based Predictive Modeling Framework for Early ICU  Mortality Prediction", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "To date, developing a good model for early intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction is still challenging. This paper presents a patient based predictive modeling framework (PPMF) to improve the performance of ICU mortality prediction using data collected during the first 48 hours of ICU admission. PPMF consists of three main components verifying three related research hypotheses. The first component captures dynamic changes of patients status in the ICU using their time series data (e.g., vital signs and laboratory tests). The second component is a local approximation algorithm that classifies patients based on their similarities. The third component is a Gradient Decent wrapper that updates feature weights according to the classification feedback. Experiments using data from MIMICIII show that PPMF significantly outperforms: (1) the severity score systems, namely SASP III, APACHE IV, and MPM0III, (2) the aggregation based classifiers that utilize summarized time series, and (3) baseline feature selection methods.", "text": "date developing good model early intensive care unit mortality prediction still challenging. paper presents

assigns weights. schools methods supervised feature weighting wrapper filter wrappers assign weights features based feedback receive classifiers iteratively filters iterative feedback cycle. example filter models researchers proposed approach assigning continuous weights attributes simply information gain values. main weakness filters treat feature independently without considering composite effects. weak features combined appropriately become strong predictor. advantage wrappers neither rely domain knowledge ignore power feature combination. weights assigned features classification

elaborates components underlying hypotheses. dynamic historical data preparation using time frames. general types data healthcare analysis including mortality prediction. static data consists patient’s features like gender race even weight height many cases. dynamic data consists multiple records patient features results diagnosis codes input output visits records. applying data mining methods dynamic data difficult since patient multiple records data mining techniques require treating patient single record consisting specified features instead multiple records feature. therefore data organized meets requirements techniques. address limitation studies look method summarize dynamic features aggregation functions give static snap-shot based dynamic records. done aggregation functions like minimum maximum average. severity score systems machine learning based mortality predictors measures. example consider worst value blood pressure glucose sodium respiratory rate based minimum maximum. snap-shot aggregations cannot adequately capture historical behavior patients. patients different situations might aggregation values. therefore believe historical data considered relatively fine-grain level improve performance current state mortality prediction methods. mortality prediction huge number records patient different time points patient records time another patient not. therefore need unified time frame format standardize patients’ time series data. achieve average feature’s value hour results data points feature. however results showed hours’ time framing gives

index manual weighting feature weights. conducted three experiments test different hypotheses. first experiment showed similarity based approach outperformed extant machine learning methods well severity score systems. reason poor performance severity score systems designed give patient specific prediction; instead appropriate population based recommendation especially daily basis. systems adequate predictive models. moreover reason baseline machine learning method outperformed ppmf designed give general approximation data. accurate mortality prediction needs consider unique behavior patient monitoring status consecutive time periods. ppmf uses local approximation models afford proposed classifier flexibility tune according patient local patients similar behavior. second experiment showed importance using patient’s time series data rather aggregation function appropriately capture dynamic behavior patients’ status. functions less accuracy since summarizing data comes information loss. consequently aggregation functions similar totally different patients. hand ppmf captures dynamic changes patients’ status diversity using proposed data points’ framework. moreover experiment shows dynamic static features providing enough contribution since ppmf outperforms classifier without dynamic static feature. dynamic features benefit static feature higher accuracy. final experiment shows significant contribution feature weighting especially weighting method used study. weighting features gives extremely poor performance since features treated way. high dimensional problems mortality prediction involves predictors data points highly expected happen. manual feature weighting effective problem since suited problems small numbers dimensions accurate domain knowledge. moreover weighting features based statistical analysis showed poor performance since treat feature individually without considering combination. complex healthcare predictive analytics problem mortality prediction high chance getting strong predictors combining weak ones. ppmf’s iterative update feature weights using gradient decent promising accuracy. approach highly beneficial enough data instances tune weights. although wrapper approach longer running time compared filter approach significantly better performance warrants potential application ppmf mortality clinical
