{"title": "Generative Adversarial Networks and Probabilistic Graph Models for  Hyperspectral Image Classification", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "High spectral dimensionality and the shortage of annotations make hyperspectral image (HSI) classification a challenging problem. Recent studies suggest that convolutional neural networks can learn discriminative spatial features, which play a paramount role in HSI interpretation. However, most of these methods ignore the distinctive spectral-spatial characteristic of hyperspectral data. In addition, a large amount of unlabeled data remains an unexploited gold mine for efficient data use. Therefore, we proposed an integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and probabilistic graphical models for HSI classification. Specifically, we used a spectral-spatial generator and a discriminator to identify land cover categories of hyperspectral cubes. Moreover, to take advantage of a large amount of unlabeled data, we adopted a conditional random field to refine the preliminary classification results generated by GANs. Experimental results obtained using two commonly studied datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved encouraging classification accuracy using a small number of data for training.", "text": "explicit approximation inference. instance deep convolutional consists discriminator generator proposed nash equilibrium between discriminator generator model optimization although gans designed unsupervised learning applied semi-supervised learning framework delivered promising recognition results probabilistic graphical models widely used post-processing image segmentations exploit large amount unlabeled data enhance classiﬁcation performance instance conditional random ﬁelds adopt high-order term consider complex relationships different spectral bands. adoption probabilistic graphical models effective take unlabeled samples account classiﬁcation method requires initialized pixel-wised prediction unlabeled data. work efﬁciently utilize spectral-spatial features abundant unlabeled data hsis tested different gans combined conditional random ﬁelds follow using training samples land cover classes datasets. shown fig. whole framework composed discriminator generator post-processing crf. inspired semi-supervised proposed spectralspatial convolutional layer construct discriminators generators. discriminator identiﬁes categories whether input hyperspectral cubes real false. additionally generator tries deceive discriminator implicitly learning representative features generate synthesized images. then conditional random ﬁeld reﬁnes posterior probability given hsis preceding classiﬁcation results. suppose feature tensors discriminators generators respectively. formulate phases follows. high spectral dimensionality shortage annotations make hyperspectral image classiﬁcation challenging problem. recent studies suggest convolutional neural networks learn discriminative spatial features play paramount role interpretation. however methods ignore distinctive spectral-spatial characteristic hyperspectral data. addition large amount unlabeled data remains unexploited gold mine efﬁcient data use. therefore proposed integration generative adversarial networks probabilistic graphical models classiﬁcation. speciﬁcally used spectral-spatial generator discriminator identify land cover categories hyperspectral cubes. moreover take advantage large amount unlabeled data adopted conditional random ﬁeld reﬁne preliminary classiﬁcation results generated gans. experimental results obtained using commonly studied datasets demonstrate proposed framework achieved encouraging classiﬁcation accuracy using small number data training. discriminative deep learning models used hyperspectral image classiﬁcation achieved high classiﬁcation accuracy commonly studied cases. convolutional neural networks used hyperspectral image feature extraction outperform traditional machine learning methods. however approaches ignored inherent difference spectral dimensionality hyperspectral images common images used computer vision tasks recently spectral-spatial residual network considers spectral-spatial characteristic hyperspectral images consecutively extracting spectral spatial features obtained state-ofart classiﬁcation results recently generative adversarial networks widely used generating images share distribution real data used unsupervised semi-supervised learning different conventional generative methods generative adversarial networks constrained markov ﬁelds copyright association advancement artiﬁcial intelligence rights reserved. conduct preliminary experiments used commonly studied hyperspectral datasets indian pines dataset university pavia data. adopted overall accuracy quantitatively measure classiﬁcation performance different models. order demonstrate effectiveness compared spetral-spatial types convolutional networks autoencoder plus traditional spatial network spectral network additionally tested post-processing conditional random ﬁelds gans. demonstrated table proposed spectral-spatial outperformed competitors cases combination layers extracts discriminative features. however spatial convolutional version performed well. furthermore crfs improved classiﬁcation accuracy models spatial constitutional layers. compared traditional machine learning methods integration deep learning models conditional random ﬁelds achieved promising results opened window semisupervisedlearning hyperspectral image classiﬁcation.", "year": 2018}
