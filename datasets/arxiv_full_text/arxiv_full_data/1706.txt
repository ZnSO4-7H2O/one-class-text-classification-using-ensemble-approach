{"title": "A Simple Approach to Multilingual Polarity Classification in Twitter", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the interest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness or negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis contests, and as starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them have important international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and SENTIPOLC (Italian). Within the competitions our approach reaches from medium to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our approach outperforms the reported results.", "text": "recently sentiment analysis received attention interest mining opinions social media users. sentiment analysis consists determining polarity given text i.e. degree positiveness negativeness. traditionally sentiment analysis algorithms tailored speciﬁc language given complexity number lexical variations errors introduced people generating content. contribution provide simple implement easy multilingual framework serve baseline sentiment analysis contests starting point build sentiment analysis systems. compare approach eight diﬀerent languages three important international contests namely semeval tass sentipolc within competitions approach reaches medium high positions rankings;

also similar surface features punctuation diacritics symbol duplication case sensitivity etc. later combination features explored best conﬁguration given classiﬁer. generally twitter messages full slang misspelling typographical grammatical errors among others; order tackle aspects consider diﬀerent parameters study eﬀect. following points parameters considered spelling features. punctuation considers symbols question mark period exclamation point commas among spelling marks. diacritic symbols commonly used languages spanish italian russian etc. wrong usage main sources orthographic errors informal texts; parameter considers absence diacritical marks. symbol reduction usually twitter messages repeated characters emphasize parts word attract user’s attention. aspect makes vocabulary explodes. applied strategy replacing repeated symbols occurrence symbol. case sensitivity considers letters normalized lowercase keep original source; words uppercase lowercase. classiﬁed around popular emoticons included text emoticons whole unicode emoticons deﬁned three classes positive negative neutral grouped corresponding polarity word deﬁned class name. n-words widely used many tasks also used sentiment analysis compute n-words text tokenized n-words calculated tokens. example \"the lights shadows future\" text -words word alone -words sequences words {the lights lights shadows shadows your future} given text size words obtain containing elements. generally n-words used addition traditional n-words representation represent resulting text q-grams. q-grams agnostic language transformation consists representing document substring length example abra cadabra text -grams transformation handles white-spaces part text. since q-grams connecting words sense applying q-grams entire text capture part syntactic contextual information sentence. rationale q-grams also tackle misspelled sentences approximate pattern matching perspective following features language dependent speciﬁc information language concerned. usually stopwords stemming negations traditionally used sentiment analysis. users approach could features part speech aﬀective lexicons etc. improve performance many languages extremely common words determiners conjunctions help build sentences carry meaning themselves. words known stopwords removed text attempt classify them. generally stopword list built using frequent terms huge document collection. used spanish english italian stopword lists included nltk python package order identify them. stemming well-known heuristic process information retrieval ﬁeld chops words often includes removal derivational aﬃxes. technique uses morphology language coded rules applied word stems reduce vocabulary collapsing derivationally related words. study snowball stemmer spanish italian porter stemmer english implemented nltk package negation markers might change polarity message. thus attached negation clue nearest word similar approaches used rules designed common negation structures involve negation markers spanish english italian. instance negation markers used spanish nunca jam´as rules processed order purpose negate nearest word negation marker using information text e.g. avoiding mainly pronouns articles. example sentence coche bonito negation marker attached adjective bonito text-transformations needed represent text suitable form order traditional classiﬁer svm. decided select well known vector representation text given simplicity powerful representation. particularly used term frequency-inverse document frequency well-known weighting scheme nlp. tf-idf computes weight represents importance words terms inside document collection documents i.e. frequently appear across multiple documents. therefore common words appear many documents score words appear frequently single document high score. weighting scheme selects terms represent document. model selection sometimes called hyper-parameter optimization essential ensure performance sentiment classiﬁer. particular approach highly parametric; fact property adapt several languages. table summarizes parameters valid values. search space contains thousand conﬁgurations limited multilingual language independent parameters; search space reaches close million conﬁgurations three languagedependent parameters. depending size training conﬁguration needs several minutes commodity server evaluated; thus exhaustive exploration parameter space quite expensive making approach useless practice. tackle eﬃciency problems perform model selection using hyper-parameter optimization algorithms. ﬁrst corresponds random search described depth random search consists randomly sampling parameter space select best conﬁguration among sample. second algorithm consists hill climbing implemented memory avoid testing conﬁguration twice. main idea behind hill climbing take pivoting conﬁguration explore conﬁguration’s neighborhood greedily moves best neighbor. process repeated improvement possible. conﬁguration neighborhood deﬁned conﬁgurations diﬀer parameter’s value. rule strengthened tokenizer diﬀer single internal value whole parameter value. precisely valid value tokenizer performance boosting comes along possible higher optimization times. finally performance conﬁguration obtained using cross-validation technique training data metrics usually used classiﬁcation accuracy score recall among others. nowadays several international competitions related text mining include diverse tasks polarity classiﬁcation subjectivity classiﬁcation entity detection iron detection among others. competitions relevant measure potential diﬀerent proposed techniques. case focused polarity classiﬁcation task hence developed baseline method acceptable performance achieved three diﬀerent contests namely tass’ semeval’ sentipolc’ addition approach tested table presents details competitions considered well languages tested. observed table number examples well number instances polarity level namely positive neutral negative none. training development sets used train sentiment classiﬁer gold used test classiﬁer. case dataset split training gold crossvalidation technique used test classiﬁer. performance classiﬁer presented using diﬀerent metrics depending competition. semeval uses average score positive negative labels tass uses accuracy sentipolc uses custom metric tested framework kinds datasets. hand compare performance three languages well known sentiment analysis contests;
