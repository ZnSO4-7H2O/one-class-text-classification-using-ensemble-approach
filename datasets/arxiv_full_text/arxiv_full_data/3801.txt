{"title": "Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Feature Selection for CRF Based Manipuri  Multiword Expression (MWE) Identification", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE", "I.2.7"], "abstract": "This paper deals with the identification of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in Manipuri, a highly agglutinative Indian Language. Manipuri is listed in the Eight Schedule of Indian Constitution. MWE plays an important role in the applications of Natural Language Processing(NLP) like Machine Translation, Part of Speech tagging, Information Retrieval, Question Answering etc. Feature selection is an important factor in the recognition of Manipuri MWEs using Conditional Random Field (CRF). The disadvantage of manual selection and choosing of the appropriate features for running CRF motivates us to think of Genetic Algorithm (GA). Using GA we are able to find the optimal features to run the CRF. We have tried with fifty generations in feature selection along with three fold cross validation as fitness function. This model demonstrated the Recall (R) of 64.08%, Precision (P) of 86.84% and F-measure (F) of 73.74%, showing an improvement over the CRF based Manipuri MWE identification without GA application.",

constituent words. example english fro’ ‘bye bye’ ‘kick bucket’ etc. mwes include compounds fixed expressions technical terms. fixed expression whose constituent words cannot moved randomly substituted without distorting overall meaning allowing literal interpretation. fixed expressions range word-compounds collocations idioms. proverbs quotations also considered fixed expressions.

quite difficult since root words manipuri noun verb words different part speech derived them. stemming work manipuri found unlike english european languages manipuri lacks capitalization information plays important role identifying name entities problem identification named entities mwes. important challenging thing manipuri word structure highly agglutinative. affixes bundled another specially suffixes. altogether affixes listed manipuri prefixes suffixes. table shows prefixes. prefix used formative pronomial prefix included list. similarly table lists suffixes suffixes used different forms

source segmenting labeling sequential data used. model identification manipuri consists mainly data training data testing. following subsection brief step model used. {wi-m wi+… wi-n swi-m swi- swi+… swi-n acceptable suffixes present word binary notation suffix present number acceptable suffixes acceptable prefixes present word binary notation prefix present binary notation general salutations previous words binary notation general follow words multiword name entities digit feature word length word frequency surrounding word frequency surrounding tag} surrounding stem words feature stemming done mentioned section preceding following stem words particular word stem current word used features since preceding following words influence present word case mwe. acceptable suffixes suffixes manually identified manipuri list suffixes used feature. mentioned example section suffixes appended another maximum number appended suffixes ten. taking cases account columns separated space word store every suffix present word. notation used columns word consists less acceptable suffixes. acceptable prefixes feature prefixes manually identified manipuri list prefixes used feature. every word prefix identified column created mentioning prefix present otherwise notation used. binary notation suffix present suffixes play important role manipuri since highly agglutinative language. every word suffix is/are present stemming binary notation used otherwise stored. binary notation prefix present prefixes play important role manipuri since highly agglutinative language. every word prefix is/are present stemming binary notation used otherwise stored. binary notation general salutations/preceding word name entity name entities generally mwes. order identify salutations like miss shri captain date precede name entity considered feature mwe. binary notation used else used. binary notation general follow words name entity mentioned above name entities generally mwes. following word current word also considered feature since name ended clan name surname words like ‘organization’ ‘lup’ organization words like ‘leikai’ ‘city’ places binary notation used else used. digit features date currency weight time generally digits. thus digit feature important feature. binary notation used word consists digit else used. word surrounding word frequency range frequencies words training corpus identified words frequency occurrences value words occurs times less times word surrounding words frequency considered feature since mwes rare occurrence compared determiners conjunctions pronouns. manipuri text document used input file. training test files consist multiple tokens. addition token consists multiple columns columns used template file. template file gives complete idea feature selection. token must represented line columns separated white spaces sequence tokens becomes sentence. undergoing training testing input document converted multiple token file fixed columns template file allows feature combination selection. example template file consists feature details example stem words word stem words word current word suffixes binary notation suffix present number suffixes prefix binary notation prefix present binary notation digit present binary notation general list salutation preceding word present binary notation general list follow word present frequency word word

identified mwes using tags b-mwe i-mwe beginning rest respectively else mwe. test file either tagging comparisons evaluation tokens regardless whether not. mentioned section chromosome pool population developed. chromosome consists genes binary valued. gene value feature selected feature selected. figure demonstrates feature representation chromosome. feature chromosome pool initial population first initial selection chromosome done. randomly selected crossover point marked crossover executed. crossover parts genes exchanged chromosomes crossover point. mutation also done random chromosomes repeated. objective mutation restoring lost exploring variety data. value changed randomly selected point process mutation. three fold cross validation technique used fitness function. three fold cross validation mean dividing corpus nearly equal parts -fold crossvalidation order obtain model file train using training file. model file ready-made file tool testing process. words model file learnt file training crf. need template file training file since model file consists detail information template file training file test file test data sequential tags mwes assigned else assigned words mwes. file created format training file i.e. fixed number columns fields training file. manipuri corpus collected filtered rectify spelling syntax sentence linguist expert linguistic department manipur university. corpus words written english words rewritten manipuri order avoid confusion error output. corpus collected includes tokens gold standard. number problems faced experiment typical nature manipuri language. manipuri word category distinct. verbs also bound category. another problem classify basic root forms according word class. although distinction noun class verb classes relatively clear; distinction nouns adjectives often vague. distinction noun adverb becomes unclear structurally word noun contextually adverb. part root also prefix leads wrong tagging. verb morphology complex noun. sometimes words fused form complete word. features selected using experiments performed order identify best feature. best features gave maximum recognition given text. experiment conducted generations. list consists surrounding words prefixes suffixes surrounding word length word frequency acceptable prefix acceptable suffix. improvement observed using reduplicated additional feature. model adopted different list best feature chosen best performance i.e. saturated output generated. best result considered system output saturated change output. happens following
