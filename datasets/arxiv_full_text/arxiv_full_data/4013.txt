{"title": "Handwritten Bangla Alphabet Recognition using an MLP Based Classifier", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "The work presented here involves the design of a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier for recognition of handwritten Bangla alphabet using a 76 element feature set Bangla is the second most popular script and language in the Indian subcontinent and the fifth most popular language in the world. The feature set developed for representing handwritten characters of Bangla alphabet includes 24 shadow features, 16 centroid features and 36 longest-run features. Recognition performances of the MLP designed to work with this feature set are experimentally observed as 86.46% and 75.05% on the samples of the training and the test sets respectively. The work has useful application in the development of a complete OCR system for handwritten Bangla text.", "text": "abstract work presented involves design multi layer perceptron based classifier

development complete system handwritten bangla text. optical character recognition still active area research especially handwritten text. success commercially available system extended handwritten text. mainly fact numerous variations writing styles individuals make recognition handwritten characters difficult. past work handwritten alphabet numerals mostly found concentrate roman script related english european languages scripts related asian languages like chinese korean japanese. among indian scripts devnagri tamil oriya bangla started receive attention related research recent years. these bangla second popular script language indian subcontinent. script used bangla ahamia manipuri languages. bangla also national language bangladesh fifth popular language world. importance bangla script language. evidences research handwritten bangla characters observed literature numbers. important research contributions relating bangla characters involve multistage approach developed rahman classifier developed bhowmik major features used multistage approach include matra upper part character disjoint section character vertical line double vertical line. classifier feature

moderately large size data samples collected different sections population used testing performances classifier. size input feature vector chosen work numerous variation writing styles different individuals also complex nature bangla alphabet automatic recognition handwritten bangla characters still poses potential problems researchers. compared roman alphabet basic bangla alphabet consists much larger number characters. number characters basic bangla alphabet characters therein resemble pair wise closely sign small difference left period small line. handwritten samples symbols basic bangla alphabet shown light facts present work considers feature features smaller previously used bhowmik recognition handwritten bangla alphabet using based classifier. non-availability standardized data recognition performances present work cannot compared others. however currently available data work shows satisfactory recognition performances specific suggestions tried future performance enhancement. feature selected present work consists features include shadow features centroid features longest-run features. features computed pixel size binary images alphabetic characters. computing shadow features character image enclosed within minimal square divided eight octants shown fig. lengths projections character images three sides octant computed. finally lengths projections sides
