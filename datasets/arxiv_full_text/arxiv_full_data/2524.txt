{"title": "Client Profiling for an Anti-Money Laundering System", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We present a data mining approach for profiling bank clients in order to support the process of detection of anti-money laundering operations. We first present the overall system architecture, and then focus on the relevant component for this paper. We detail the experiments performed on real world data from a financial institution, which allowed us to group clients in clusters and then generate a set of classification rules. We discuss the relevance of the founded client profiles and of the generated classification rules. According to the defined overall agent-based architecture, these rules will be incorporated in the knowledge base of the intelligent agents responsible for the signaling of suspicious transactions.", "text": "abstract—we present data mining approach proﬁling bank clients order support process detection antimoney laundering operations. ﬁrst present overall system architecture focus relevant component paper. detail experiments performed real world data ﬁnancial institution allowed group clients clusters generate classiﬁcation rules. discuss relevance founded client proﬁles generated classiﬁcation rules. according deﬁned overall agent-based architecture rules incorporated knowledge base intelligent agents responsible signaling suspicious transactions. acts prevention ﬁght money laundering crimes prioritized almost every government world level relevant global issues. money laundering crime typically consists making certain illegal ﬁnancial gain legal gain. according united nations ofﬁce drugs crimes annual global estimate laundered money gross world product billion trillion ﬁnancial volume enough another reason governments focus crime fact clearly connected types crimes illegal drug trade fraud corruption kidnapping terrorism arms smuggling among others. countries’ ﬁnancial authorities usually central banks responsible controlling deﬁning antimoney laundering regulations demanding ﬁnancial institutions implementation procedures apply deﬁned norms. however increase amount ﬁnancial transactions along high frequency publication national international rules cause lack efﬁciency timing ﬁght prevention activity. sophistication criminal activity critical part process still performed human analysts. make identiﬁcation analysis suspect transactions agile using data mining techniques intelligent agents reducing need human intervention main goal doctoral project detailed paper focus results related systems components identiﬁcation ﬁnancial institution’s customers’ behavior patterns using entire checking accounts transaction database transactions made year. section provide context work presenting system present research used. section present related work data mining techniques ﬁnancial applications. money laundering characterized commercial ﬁnancial operations incorporate country’s economy transitory permanent illicitly obtained resources goods values. motivation using intelligent agent based solution results analysis problem described mainly observation tasks want automate match perfectly principles behind multi-agent system deﬁnition need entities autonomy accomplish speciﬁc tasks keep contact agents order reach common objective. every agent must knowledge able ponder come intelligent decision. besides need present scalability ﬂexible consider groups agents according role process. ﬁrst group responsible capturing suspicious transactions second responsible analyzing suspicious transactions identiﬁed agents ﬁrst group. fig. shows schematic view global architecture proposed system. work necessary know customers’ behavior patterns establish controlling rules. rules resulting deﬁned norms made ﬁnancial system regulator entities included controlling rules. fig. also shows highlight step called learning incorporates method describe paper. considering data transformation process especially critical work discretization process also applied data order adequate clusters. resources mapped dimensional euclidean space customer’s attributes dimension time another transactions. customers’ transactions projected according time accumulating transactions frequency create histogram. clusters created based segments histogram. analyses local global correlations applied detect suspicious patterns. good analyze individual behavior and/or group behavior examine operations detect suspicious behaviors related abnormal peaks histogram. however necessary analyze number clients transactions long period time become difﬁcult detect suspicious cases since might peaks none histogram. authors propose extension support vector machine detect customers’ abnormal behavior. combination kernel presented improvements deﬁnition distinct distances supervised unsupervised algorithms. class supervised learning used detect value anomalies group data without classes. advantage approach deal heterogeneous datasets. clustering proposed simple center-based clustering technique used detect suspicious cases money laundering. technique based main characteristics used creation process entry. preliminary results show approach efﬁcient. however number characteristics training patterns small could affect precision. authors present case study corresponding application knowledge base solution combines data mining techniques clustering neural networks genetic algorithms detect money-laundering patterns. basically differentiates types learning existence class attribute docketing registries data group used. class exists learning process supervised;
