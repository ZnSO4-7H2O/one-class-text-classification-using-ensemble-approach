Building on methods developed for analysis of the neural code, we show that reliable estimates of mutual information can be obtained with manageable computational effort. The same methods allow estimation of higher order, multi--information terms. These ideas are illustrated by analyses of gene expression, financial markets, and consumer preferences. In each case, information theoretic measures correlate with independent, intuitive measures of the underlying structures in the system.", "text": "address practical problems estimating information relations characterize large networks. building methods developed analysis neural code show reliable estimates mutual information obtained manageable computational eﬀort. methods allow estimation higher order multi–information terms. ideas illustrated analyses gene expression ﬁnancial markets consumer preferences. case information theoretic measures correlate independent intuitive measures underlying structures system. many problems current scientiﬁc interest described least colloquially control information. ﬁfty years since shannon formalized intuitive notions information relatively ﬁelds actually information theoretic methods analysis experimental data. part problem practical information theoretic quantities notoriously diﬃcult estimate limited samples data problem expands combinatorially look relationships among variables. faced diﬃculties investigators resort simpler statistical measures even though choice measure somewhat arbitrary. build methods developed information theoretic analysis neural code show practical problems tamed even large networks need estimate millions information relations order give complete characterization system. emphasize generality issues give examples analyses gene expression ﬁnancial markets consumer preferences. diﬃculty sets possible stimuli possible responses large sampling joint distribution therefore diﬃcult. naively identifying observed frequencies events probabilities leads systematic errors underestimating entropies overestimating mutual information. large literature correct errors going back miller’s calculation magnitude asymptotic limit large ﬁnite sample size strong showed mutual information stimuli responses could estimated reliably making ideas. first averages distribution stimuli replaced averages time using ergodicity. second sample size dependence information estimates examined explicitly verify data asymptotic limit hence extrapolate inﬁnite sample size miller’s calculation;

achieving roughly constant error bars throughout ﬁtting region requires mentioned earlier procedure valid depends indeed fig. plateau results less stable information overestimated. determine general given identifying plateau always trivial? simple approach apply procedure diﬀerent values large number pairs observations randomly reshuﬄed. here positive values merely indicate small sample eﬀects properly corrected. fig. present pairs randomly reshuﬄed gene expression proﬁles function based ﬁgure chose value pairs. notice though approach might yield under-estimation eﬀects especially highly informative pairs. procedure completed estimating choosing last extrapolated value provides signiﬁcant improvement less detailed quantizations. multi–information captures collective properties pairwise relations general information theoretic framework. clear estimating term challenging since number parameters relevant joint distribution exponential nonetheless show triplet information values estimated reliably. start multi–information chain rule decomposing mutual information terms idea could applied number sub–sample sizes. signiﬁcant improvement mean improvement beyond error bar. simple scheme deﬁne error bars standard deviation naive values obtained smallest sub–sample used extrapolation. note tried alternatives signiﬁcant eﬀect. thus directly apply procedure estimate pairwise information terms ending estimate triplet information. note quantized versions combined single quantized variable bins hence relevant joint distribution consists entries. thus increasing quantization level limited data diﬃcult expect lower bound order avoid overestimates. note also diﬀerent ways estimate triplet information term permuting provides built veriﬁcation scheme every term estimated diﬀerent compositions resulting estimates compared other. ﬁrst data consider expression responses yeast genes various forms environmental stress every gene represented log–ratio expression levels conditions. concentrate genes characterized participating environmental stress response module;
