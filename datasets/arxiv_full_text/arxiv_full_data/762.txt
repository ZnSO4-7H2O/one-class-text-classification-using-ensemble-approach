{"title": "Learning Bayesian Network Equivalence Classes with Ant Colony  Optimization", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Bayesian networks are a useful tool in the representation of uncertain knowledge. This paper proposes a new algorithm called ACO-E, to learn the structure of a Bayesian network. It does this by conducting a search through the space of equivalence classes of Bayesian networks using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). To this end, two novel extensions of traditional ACO techniques are proposed and implemented. Firstly, multiple types of moves are allowed. Secondly, moves can be given in terms of indices that are not based on construction graph nodes. The results of testing show that ACO-E performs better than a greedy search and other state-of-the-art and metaheuristic algorithms whilst searching in the space of equivalence classes.", "text": "bayesian networks useful tool representation uncertain knowledge. paper proposes algorithm called aco-e learn structure bayesian network. conducting search space equivalence classes bayesian networks using colony optimization novel extensions traditional techniques proposed implemented. firstly multiple types moves allowed. secondly moves given terms indices based construction graph nodes. results testing show aco-e performs better greedy search state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms whilst searching space equivalence classes. task learning bayesian networks data relatively short amount time become mainstream application process knowledge discovery model building reasons many. model built process intuitive feel bayesian network consists directed acyclic graph conditional probability tables annotating node. node graph represents variable interest problem domain arcs seen represent causal relations variables nature causal relations governed conditional probability tables associated node/variable. example bayesian network shown figure another reason popularity bayesian networks aside visual attractiveness model underlying theory quite well understood solid foundation. bayesian network seen factorization joint probability distribution conditional probability distributions node making factors graph structure making method combination. equivalence network answer probabilistic question regarding variables modeled.", "year": 2014}
