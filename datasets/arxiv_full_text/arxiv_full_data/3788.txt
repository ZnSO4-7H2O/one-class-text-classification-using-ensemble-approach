Fitting functions that exhibit multiple solutions as local minima can be analysed in terms of the corresponding machine learning landscape. Methods to explore and visualise molecular potential energy landscapes can be applied to these machine learning landscapes to gain new insight into the solution space involved in training and the nature of the corresponding predictions. In particular, we can define quantities analogous to molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics, and relate these emergent properties to the structure of the underlying landscape. This Perspective aims to describe these analogies with examples from recent applications, and suggest avenues for new interdisciplinary research.", "text": "partial sums training minima order increasing enn. ﬁrst peak around arises competition lowest minima. second peak around reproduced lowest minima included largest peak around appears minimum latter solution problem. create identical models split training data half. using ﬁrst half data train ﬁrst network thereby obtaining point small value using create labels second half data replacing true labels output ﬁrst model using data pairs train second network. procedure ensures loss function", "year": 2017}
