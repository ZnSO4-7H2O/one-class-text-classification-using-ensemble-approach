{"title": "Skin-color based videos categorization", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "On dedicated websites, people can upload videos and share it with the rest of the world. Currently these videos are cat- egorized manually by the help of the user community. In this paper, we propose a combination of color spaces with the Bayesian network approach for robust detection of skin color followed by an automated video categorization. Exper- imental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory performance for categorizing videos based on skin color.", "text": "goal system categorize videos based skin color. depending

many face recognition gesture tracking systems skin information contributes much object recognition usage skin color based tracking locating categorization could blocking unwanted video contents world wide web. dedicated websites people upload videos share rest world. uploaded adult videos allowed service providers. therefore effectively categorize block videos arousing serious concern service providers. mostly used approach contents blocking internet based contextual keyword pattern matching technology categorizes urls means checking contexts pages video names traps websites hold true websites allow uploading videos like google videos youtube videos uploaded different names contents contain. automated process google youtube rely user’s community. therefore automated method detect categorize videos based skin color help service providers provide control videos contents. according smeulders color active area research image retrieval branch computer vision. interest color ascribed superior discriminating potentiality three images combine phosphor screen produce composite color image. color space widely used color spaces storing processing digital image however color space alone reliable identifying skin colored pixels since represents color also luminance skin luminance vary within across persons ambient lighting therefore suitable segmenting skin non-skin regions. chromatic colors reliable obtained eliminating luminance nonlinear transformations cbcr encoded nonlinear signal commonly used european television studios image compression work color

according selection color space influences quality skin color modeling. pixels belonging skin region exhibit similar chromatic characteristics therefore skin color model based values provide good
