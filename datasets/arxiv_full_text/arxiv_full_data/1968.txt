{"title": "Static Gesture Recognition using Leap Motion", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.HC"], "abstract": "In this report, an automated bartender system was developed for making orders in a bar using hand gestures. The gesture recognition of the system was developed using Machine Learning techniques, where the model was trained to classify gestures using collected data. The final model used in the system reached an average accuracy of 95%. The system raised ethical concerns both in terms of user interaction and having such a system in a real world scenario, but it could initially work as a complement to a real bartender.", "text":

often seen universal language often overseen aspect hand gestures different meaning different cultures. example thumbs gesture regarded positive sign western world interpreted foul insult iraq. choosing hand gestures system take aspects consideration. however case cultural differences solution could customize system different hand gestures depending region. important part development system agnostic type user work well independently features user’s hands. feature size using normalization technique described section ii-a makes system work relative distances instead absolute. result recognition works well people hand sizes. another aspect skin color using infrared lights leap motion instead methods tracking pixel colors system never considers feature. visual interface well audio feedback used convey interaction user bartender system. reading displayed text loud allows users visual impairment system well. language today limited english extending languages could improvement include larger audience. however system discriminate sense required hands ﬁngers order also assumed co-relation lengths ﬁngers generalized within dataset system trained with. major ethical concerns aware chose address order limit extent project. going beyond technical approach previously discussed ethical concerns also important discuss extended responsibilities human bartender beyond serving taking orders. working demands ability making decisions regarding appropriate i.e. sell alcohol selling alcohol intoxicated individuals minors raise moral legal issues bartender responsibility for. since system juridical entity cannot held responsible making decisions. automated bartender system requires extra layer decisionmaking system developed project support. incorporate this system would become many times complex even full support would still need human charge ensure nothing goes wrong. started project booking re-occurring meetings workshops. mostly working times made sure everyone similar amount effort project. early timeline including breakdown project number tasks made. using timeline base assignments speciﬁc roles within group made instead simply divided tasks depending current priority progress. work often done smaller groups groupings changed depending task. utilizing booked meetings combining frequent communication group good start continuously worked throughout project. conclude group members took responsibility contributed project. potential future work would extend hand gestures current static continuous could make natural human interaction. would also extend number possible gestures used. another part project could extended aspect gestures. choice gestures could whole project possible angle studying important relation gestures well making gestures user friendly possible. gestures project observed frequently misclassiﬁed choosing better distinguishable gestures could improve accuracy. system worked successfully using classifying model results reached accuracy shown perform better implementations neural networks amount data. however raise multiple ethical concerns terms using system impact similar system implemented reality. users example
