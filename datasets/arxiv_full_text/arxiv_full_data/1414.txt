{"title": "Discovery Radiomics via Evolutionary Deep Radiomic Sequencer Discovery  for Pathologically-Proven Lung Cancer Detection", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "While lung cancer is the second most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, a sufficiently early diagnosis can be pivotal in patient survival rates. Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity (93.42%), specificity (82.39%), and diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.", "text": "mohammad javad shaﬁee* audrey chung farzad khalvati masoom haider alexander wong vision image processing research group university waterloo waterloo canada department medical imaging university toronto sunnybrook research institute toronto canada abstract. lung cancer second diagnosed form cancer women sufﬁciently early diagnosis pivotal patient survival rates. imaging-based radiomics-driven detection methods developed diagnosticians largely rely hand-crafted features fully encapsulate differences cancerous healthy tissue. recently concept discovery radiomics introduced custom abstract features discovered readily available imaging data. propose novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based evolutionary deep intelligence. motivated patient privacy concerns idea operational artiﬁcial intelligence evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly efﬁcient deep radiomic sequencers produce signiﬁcantly compact similarly descriptive radiomic sequences multiple generations. result framework improves operational efﬁciency enables diagnosis locally radiologist’s computer maintaining detection accuracy. evaluated evolved deep radiomic sequencer discovered proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework state-of-the-art radiomics-driven discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung data pathologically-proven diagnostic data lidc-idri dataset. evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows improved sensitivity speciﬁcity diagnostic accuracy relative previous radiomics approaches. overview discovery radiomics framework cancer detection. custom radiomic sequencer discovered past medical imaging data; patients radiomic sequences abstract imaging-based features generated quantiﬁcation analysis. evolutionary deep intelligence framework; heredity encoded probabilistic modeling architectural traits carried next generation. environmental conditions simulate factors must considered synthesized offspring network. evolutionary approach repeated multiple generations conditional satisﬁed latest generation. evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery synthesize optimized radiomic sequencer archive medical images generation past radiomic sequencer archive medical images used evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery process synthesize efﬁcient radiomic sequencer. shown size parameters radiomic sequencer decreased generation resulting concise radiomic sequence describe input radiology image. deep radiomic sequencer based deep convolutional neural network architecture. input deep convolutional neural network suspicious region image. architecture original ancestor network lenet network architecture ﬁlters ﬁrst second layers ﬁlters third layers last layer. output last layer generate radiomic sequence feature length. learning composed three concatenated convolutional layers convolutional kernels size convolutional layer followed rectiﬁed linear unit max-pooling layer running time evaluation synthesized radiomic sequencer generation evaluated sample inputs. seen subsequent radiomic sequencers perform faster ancestors shows efﬁciency synthesized sequencer discovered proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery process. table radiomic sequence lengths modeling accuracies generations. a.n.f stands average number ﬁlters sequencer r.s.l column represents average length radiomic sequence generation. since numbers averaged folds evaluation reported ﬂoating point precision. seen radiomic sequences become compact generations modeling accuracy sensitivity speciﬁcity increasing. table comparison state-other-the-art methods lung cancer classiﬁcation. seen proposed edrs framework outperforms methods sensitivity speciﬁcity accuracy. speciﬁcity radiomic sequencer overlaid modeling standard deviation generations. seen generalizability radiomic sequencer increase generation generation standard deviation modeling decreases.", "year": 2017}
