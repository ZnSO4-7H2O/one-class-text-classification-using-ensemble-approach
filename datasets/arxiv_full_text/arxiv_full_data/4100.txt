{"title": "Natural scene statistics mediate the perception of image complexity", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "Humans are sensitive to complexity and regularity in patterns. The subjective perception of pattern complexity is correlated to algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity as defined in computer science, but also to the frequency of naturally occurring patterns. However, the possible mediational role of natural frequencies in the perception of algorithmic complexity remains unclear. Here we reanalyze Hsu et al. (2010) through a mediational analysis, and complement their results in a new experiment. We conclude that human perception of complexity seems partly shaped by natural scenes statistics, thereby establishing a link between the perception of complexity and the effect of natural scene statistics.", "text": "humans sensitive complexity regularity patterns subjective perception pattern complexity correlated algorithmic complexity deﬁned computer science also frequency naturally occurring patterns however possible mediational role natural frequencies perception algorithmic complexity remains unclear. reanalyze mediational analysis complement results experiment. conclude human perception complexity seems partly shaped natural scenes statistics thereby establishing link perception complexity eﬀect natural scene statistics. humans extremely sensitive patterns regularities brains detect slight departures randomness. someone throwing dice getting three pattern likely stunned fact combinations regular incredulous face meager evidence dice general human feature—the discernment rules governing world—may thought cognitive basis science also adaptive ability shaped natural evolution avoid predictable dangers. psychologists linked natural perception randomness mathematical theory algorithmic complexity complex stimulus random perceived formally algorithmic complexity sequence length shortest program produces sequence question halts deﬁnition said program doesn’t involve speciﬁc computer rather general universal turing machine abstract computer. algorithmic complexity related probability machine random program produce particular sequence halt link formally proven coding theorem initially conceived solve problem induction—which general powerful powerful measure indeed ultimately uncomputable though approximations possible. main intuition behind algorithmic probability sequence random contain regularity encoded computer program length shorter sequence generate mechanistic means. shorter programs likely occur therefore frequent longer ones program instruction uniformly randomly chosen establishes powerful connection complexity frequency. within framework algorithmic complexity theory randomness complexity interchangeable concepts formal deﬁnition randomness relies complexity complexity direct measure randomness. hypothesis human perception randomness linked algorithmic complexity could veriﬁed prior recent developments computer science. indeed methods long existed allow satisfactory estimations algorithmic randomness long sequences compression algorithms recently methods available assess algorithmic complexity short sequences light algorithmic complexity undertook investigation humans perceive randomness learn perceive complexity. griﬃths schreiber advanced interesting hypothesis frequency pattern appears real world scenes could explain perceive randomness permitting infer complexity world see. scanned photographs real world natuprobability array appears chance every cell array selected random chose balanced arrays probabilities occurrence real scenes ranging high. subjects decide whether arrays looked random not. measure subjective randomness array. found subjective probability natural randomness positively correlated particular arrays computed kolmogorov-chaitin complexity also signiﬁcantly linked subjective perception randomness. arrays published found correlation two-dimensional algorithmic complexity deﬁned zenil —see also gauvrit zenil delahaye solertoscano —and subjective probability. pattern correlations surprising. world thought generator patterns like random computer program probability array occur world linked algorithmic complexity. indeed computed arrays also found positive correlation between algorithmic complexity natural scene statistics could natural scene statistics account human perception algorithmic complexity?
