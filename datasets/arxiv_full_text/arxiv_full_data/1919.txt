{"title": "Stacking With Auxiliary Features", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Ensembling methods are well known for improving prediction accuracy. However, they are limited in the sense that they cannot discriminate among component models effectively. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features that learns to fuse relevant information from multiple systems to improve performance. Auxiliary features enable the stacker to rely on systems that not just agree on an output but also the provenance of the output. We demonstrate our approach on three very different and difficult problems -- the Cold Start Slot Filling, the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking and the ImageNet object detection tasks. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on the first two tasks and substantial improvements on the detection task, thus verifying the power and generality of our approach.", "text": "ensembling methods

generalization perform multi-layer object recognition paper ﬁrst stacking ensembling multiple object detectors obtain substantial improvements component systems. goal cssf collect information speciﬁc attributes entities given corpus. queries entities person organization geo-political entity slots ﬁxed task also included inverse slot example slot orgsubsidiaries inverse orgparents. slots single-valued others list-valued i.e. take multiple slot ﬁllers. input cssf queries corpus look information. queries provided format includes query name entity type entity corpus consists documents format discussion forums newswire internet identiﬁed unique output slot ﬁlls query. along slot-ﬁlls systems must also provide provenance corpus form docidstartoffset-endoffset docid speciﬁes source document offsets demarcate text document containing extracted ﬁller. systems also provide conﬁdence score indicate certainty extracted information. goal tedl discover entity mentions corpus english

approach stacking multiple systems using conﬁdence scores auxiliary features. figure shows overview system trains ﬁnal meta-classiﬁer combining multiple systems. auxiliary features depend task consideration described section stacking popular ensembling methodology machine learning successful many applications including performing systems netﬂix competition idea employ multiple learners combine predictions training meta-classiﬁer weigh combine multiple models using conﬁdence scores features. training supervised data disjoint used train individual models learns combine results improved ensemble model performs better individual component system. order successfully stacking output must represented key-value pair. meta-classiﬁer makes binary decision distinct output pair. thus deploying algorithm task crucial identify task output serves unique handle ensembling systems well values results provided systems. note instance output could multiple values component systems. output ensembling system similar output individual system productively aggregates results different systems. ﬁnal post-processing step outputs classiﬁed correct\" classiﬁer kept others removed output. ﬁrst step towards using stacker represent output key-value pair. cssf task ensembling multiple systems query along slot type example perage barack obama value computed slot ﬁll. list-valued slot types orgsubsidiaries instance repeated output value. tedl task deﬁne value mention speciﬁc reference entity text. imagenet object detection task represent image ensembling value detected object category. next step represent output pair instances consistently. particular key-value pair system produced also provides conﬁdence score else conﬁdence score zero i.e. output instance incorrect according system. output ready stacker shown figure along conﬁdence scores also feed auxiliary features described next section task enable classiﬁer discriminate across component systems effectively thus make better decisions. discussed earlier systems must provide evidence form provenance generated output pair. part auxiliary features stacker along conﬁdence scores shown part figure provenance indicates origin source generated output instance thus depends task considerations. cssf task system successfully extracts relation must provide slot ﬁller provenance indicating location extracted slot corpus. provenance explicit tasks object detection task. tasks serves output justiﬁcation form text. hand detection task output justiﬁcation form bounding boxes thus serves purpose provenance. tedl task system successfully links mention must provide mention provenance indicating origin mention corpus. cssf tedl tasks provenance form docid startoffset-endoffset gives information document corpus offset document. hand imagenet object detection task system successfully detects target category must provide object bounding localizing object image. bounding form xmin ymin xmax ymax. bounding object detection similar provenance tasks thus used auxiliary features stacking. idea behind using provenance auxiliary features output reliable multiple systems produce also agree source/provenance decision. order enable stacker leverage auxiliary features discriminating among systems develop features measure provenance similarity across systems. jaccard similarity coefﬁcient statistical measure similarity sets thus useful measuring degree overlap provenance provided systems. cssf tedl tasks provenance offsets used capture similarity follows. given systems generate value docid document provenance provenance offset score calculated intersection offset strings divided union. thus systems generate value different documents zero overlap among offsets. object detection task jaccard coefﬁcient used measure overlap bounding boxes across systems. given image systems detect object instance bounding overlap score calculated intersection areas bounding boxes divided union note cssf task systems said extracted slot ﬁlls exactly same however tedl task systems said linked mention mentions overlap extent ﬁnally imagenet task systems said detected object instance intersection union areas bounding boxes greater output values don’t meet criteria given considered different values key. tasks also docid information auxiliary features. given systems provide value maximum systems give docid provenance document provenance score systems n/n. similarly systems given lower scores based fraction systems whose provenance document agrees theirs. since provenance score weighted number systems refer provenance measures reliability value based document originated. note provenance features require access large corpus documents image thus computationally inexpensive. additional auxiliary features slot type cssf task tedl entity type imagenet task object category additional feature. cssf task features related provenance discussed also used however novel auxiliary features tasks require access source corpus boosts performance beats best ensemble. cssf task much smaller corpus shorter documents compared previous year’s slot-ﬁlling corpus thus provenance feature sufﬁciently capture reliability slot based extracted. auxiliary feature measures similarity document value document. cssf task query entity along slot type thus document query document provided participants disambiguate query entities could potentially name refer different entities. tedl task entity thus document pseudo-document made entity’s description well several relations involving entity exist document cssf tedl systems provide provenance value document tasks. auxiliary feature uses cosine similarity compare value documents represented standard tf-idf weighted vectors. imagenet task object class label additional feature. systems well categories deformable objects. using class label enables stacker learn discriminate across systems. obtain decisions key-value pairs stacker perform ﬁnal post-processing output stacker though generated single system. cssf straight forward. list-valued slot classiﬁed correct included ﬁnal output. single-valued slot ﬁlls multiple ﬁlls classiﬁed correctly query slot type include highest meta-classiﬁer conﬁdence. tedl entity mention link classiﬁed correct link cluster include ﬁnal output link cluster keep aside mention links processed. thereafter resolve across systems since id’s system unique. merge clusters across systems least common entity mention among them. finally give newly merged clusters. imagenet object detection task object instance classiﬁed correct stacker included ﬁnal output bounding output instance calculated follows. multiple systems successfully detected object instance overlapping areas system’s bounding every system’s also detected exact instance every system. bounding produced system maximum overlapping area included ﬁnal output. note case systems method redundant include bounding produced systems higher conﬁdence score. section describes comprehensive experiments evaluating swaf tasks imagenet object detection task using algorithm described previous section comparing full
