{"title": "Lifted Representation of Relational Causal Models Revisited:  Implications for Reasoning and Structure Learning", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Maier et al. (2010) introduced the relational causal model (RCM) for representing and inferring causal relationships in relational data. A lifted representation, called abstract ground graph (AGG), plays a central role in reasoning with and learning of RCM. The correctness of the algorithm proposed by Maier et al. (2013a) for learning RCM from data relies on the soundness and completeness of AGG for relational d-separation to reduce the learning of an RCM to learning of an AGG. We revisit the definition of AGG and show that AGG, as defined in Maier et al. (2013b), does not correctly abstract all ground graphs. We revise the definition of AGG to ensure that it correctly abstracts all ground graphs. We further show that AGG representation is not complete for relational d-separation, that is, there can exist conditional independence relations in an RCM that are not entailed by AGG. A careful examination of the relationship between the lack of completeness of AGG for relational d-separation and faithfulness conditions suggests that weaker notions of completeness, namely adjacency faithfulness and orientation faithfulness between an RCM and its AGG, can be used to learn an RCM from data.", "text": "introduced relational maier causal model representing inferring causal relationships relational data. lifted representation called abstract ground graph plays central role reasoning learning rcm. correctness algorithm proposed maier learning data relies soundness completeness relational dseparation reduce learning learning agg. revisit deﬁnition show deﬁned maier correctly abstract ground graphs. revise deﬁnition ensure correctly abstracts ground graphs. show representation complete relational dseparation exist conditional independence relations entailed agg. careful examination relationship lack completeness relational d-separation faithfulness conditions suggests weaker notions completeness namely adjacency faithfulness orientation faithfulness used learn data. discovery causal relationships observational experimental data central problem applications across multiple areas scientiﬁc endeavor. considerable progress past decades algorithms eliciting causal relationships data broad range assumptions algorithms causal discovery assume propositional data instances independent identically distributed. however many real world applications assumptions violated underlying data relational structure sort modeled practice entity-relationship model considerable work learning predictive models relational data furthermore researchers different disciplines studied causal relationships resulting phenomena relational world e.g. peer effects social contagion viral marketing information diffusion motivated limitations traditional approaches learning causal relationships relational data maier colleagues introduced relational causal model provided sound complete causal structure learning algorithm called relational causal discovery algorithm inferring causal relationships relational data. idea behind cause effects direct indirect relationship reﬂected relational data. traditional approaches reasoning learning causal model cannot trivially applied relational causal model reasoning infer relational version conditional independence makes lifted representation called abstract ground graphs traditional graphical criteria used answer relational queries. lifted representation employed internal learning structure reﬂect inferred results among relational version variables. makes orientation rule designed speciﬁcally rcm. motivation contributions offer attractive model representing reasoning about learning causal relationships implicit relational data. arbour proposed relational version propensity score matching method infer causal effects observational data. marazopoulou extended cope temporal relational data. generalized temporal temporal respectively. lifted representation called abstract ground graph plays central role reasoning learning rcm. correctness algorithms proposed maier learning marazopoulou temporal respectively observational data rely soundness completeness relational d-separation reduce learning learning agg. main contributions paper follows show deﬁned maier correctly abstract ground graphs;
