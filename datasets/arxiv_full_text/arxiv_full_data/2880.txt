For an arbitrary skeleton and depth image, an evolutionary algorithm is used to find the optimal kinematic configuration to explain the observed image. Results show that our approach can correctly estimate poses of 39 and 78 degree-of-freedom models from a single depth image, even in cases of significant self-occlusion.", "text": "fig. diagram illustrating process inferring poses single depth image using arbitrary skeleton. given data depth image parameterizable skeleton algorithm parameters pose skeleton best explain data. comparison gall used motion capture markerless camera systems poses complex models generated animals non-rigid garments. however approach required laser scanned visual-hulls mapped human experts underlying kinematic structure. alternative approach katz inferred relational representations articulated objects tracking visual features limited planar objects requires interactions infer underlying structure. skeleton model parameters point observed depth image closest point model point given parameters standard deviation point distances depth image. abstract—we present method estimating pose information single depth image given arbitrary kinematic structure without prior training. arbitrary skeleton depth image evolutionary algorithm used optimal kinematic conﬁguration explain observed image. results show approach correctly estimate poses degree-of-freedom models single depth image even cases signiﬁcant self-occlusion. able estimate three-dimensional pose articulated articated object robot human important variety applications recent technological advances made capturing depth images convenient affordable extracting pose information images remains challenge—even kinematic structure target provided. popular approaches often rely domain speciﬁc knowledge extensive training thus providing little generality arbitrary skeletons little training data exists. paper presents results estimating poses arbitrary kinematic skeleton single depth image without prior training. pose estimation deﬁned modelbased estimation problem evolutionary algorithm applied optimal pose. rather using priori beliefs pre-trained models algorithm extracts likely conﬁguration based solely kinematic structure explain observed depth image vast majority pose estimation research focused speciﬁcally human kinematic skeleton. recent surveys describe primary directions pose assembly probabilistic detection body parts example-based methods. example shotton described particularly successful approach human pose recognition builds probabilistic decision tree ﬁrst approximate pose body parts followed local optimization step. technique fast reliable relies signiﬁcant training core hours training million randomized poses. primary limitation techniques reliance domain speciﬁc information regarding human kinematics generalize arbitrary skeletons without explicit additional training. therefore evolutionary algorithm pose parameters. evolutionary algorithm population-based heuristic algorithm iteratively selects combines solutions produce increasingly better models skeleton represented acyclic graph links parameterizable joint angles length. traditional evolutionary operators used random mutations applied parameters recombination swaps branches links parents produce offspring. captured data articulated robot using kinect camera’s depth sensor images drastically distinct subjects captured ﬁrst spider model based quadruped robot links resulting degrees-of-freedom second humanoid model consisting links amounting degrees-of-freedom. spider model arranged robot four distinct poses collected images ranging inclination angles taken poses; resulting total twenty depth images. multiple examples self-occlusion data set. humanoid model eight images taken four subjects totaling images. images data sets pre-processed background subtraction. learning algorithm objective function evaluations approximately iterations. single core .ghz intel processor required approximately minutes computational effort image spider humanoid models respectively. results evolutionary algorithm indicate successful pose estimation spider humanoid models even signiﬁcant self-occlusion quantitatively model placed links correct position accuracy spider humanoid model respectively. qualitatively scoring survey scale spiders scored humanoid model achieved score. compared results hill-climbing baseline learning algorithm produced mariginally superior results lowdimensional spider model. however high-dimensional humanoid model sharp contrast performance. evolutionary approach able consistently infer reasonable approximation model hill-climbing approach often caught local optima drastically different ground truth. results indicate high-dimensional problems overlapping workspaces proposed learning method vastly superior determining pose information. work supported part nida grant grant eccs dtra grant hdtra ---. thanks nserc support program. content paper solely responsibility authors necessarily represent ofﬁcial views sponsoring organizations.", "year": 2011}
