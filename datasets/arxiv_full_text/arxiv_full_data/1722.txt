{"title": "Rapid Adaptation of POS Tagging for Domain Specific Uses", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "abstract": "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental component for performing natural language tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and question answering. When POS taggers are trained in one domain and applied in significantly different domains, their performance can degrade dramatically. We present a methodology for rapid adaptation of POS taggers to new domains. Our technique is unsupervised in that a manually annotated corpus for the new domain is not necessary. We use suffix information gathered from large amounts of raw text as well as orthographic information to increase the lexical coverage. We present an experiment in the Biological domain where our POS tagger achieves results comparable to POS taggers specifically trained to this domain.", "text": "part-of-speech tagging fundamental component performing natural language tasks parsing information extraction question answering. taggers trained domain applied significantly different domains performance degrade dramatically. present methodology rapid adaptation taggers domains. technique unsupervised manually annotated corpus domain necessary. suffix information gathered large amounts text well orthographic information increase lexical coverage. present experiment biological domain tagger achieves results comparable taggers specifically trained domain. many machine-learning statistical techniques employed tagging train model annotated corpus penn treebank state-of-the-art taggers main sources information information neighboring tags information word itself. methods using sources information tagging hidden markov modeling maximum entropy modeling transformation based learning moving domain performance degrade dramatically increase unknown word rate well domain-specific word use. improve tagging performance attacking problems. since goal employ minimal manual effort domain-specific knowledge consider orthographic inflectional derivational information deriving pos. bypass time cost resource content expert intensive approach annotating corpus domain. initial components tagging process lexicon part speech tagger trained generic domain corpus. lexicon updated include domain specific information based suffix rules applied un-annotated corpus. documents domain tagged using updated lexicon orthographic information. tagger uses domain specific updated lexicon along knows generic training process domain specific text output tags. demonstrating feasibility approach used fntbl-. tagger based brill’s transformation based learning along lexicon contextual rules trained wall street journal corpus. update lexicon processed abstracts five compressed data files pubmed/medline database result update coverage words tags lexicon increased test corpus. suffix rules composed based information michigan state university’s suffixes parts speech page graduate record exams suffix endings indicate used words. however seen table suffix examples below significant lack precision assigning based suffixes. suffixes well determining actual assigned word. broad well. -ate typically forms verb noun adjective generic domain. however scientific domains often indicates noun adjective word form. since fntbl tagger gives preliminary assignment tags based first listed word lexicon vital first common word correct. words ending ‘-ing’ used verbal adjectival noun sense. intuition ‘-ed’ form also appear often verbal sense dominates. contrast ratio heavily favors ‘-ing’ form expect noun sense dominate. incorporated reasoning computationally defined process assigned first following words binding imaging learning nursing processing screening signaling smoking training underlying. underlying seems place list. testing purposes used approximately half abstracts genia corpus described genia corpus distinguish common proper nouns dropped distinction evaluating tagger performance. original fntbl tagger accuracy genia test corpus showing deals well unknown words domain. rapid adaptation tagger achieves modest absolute improvement accuracy equates error reduction. little difference performance between rapid adaptation tagger medpost pennbioie taggers. pennbioie tagger employs maximum entropy modeling developed using manually annotated medline abstracts. medpost tagger also used domain-specific annotated corpora word lexicon manually updated tags. improved accuracy fntbl. tagger domain adding words tags lexicon unsupervised methods processing text domain. accuracy resulting tagger compares well trained domain using annotation effort domain-specific knowledge. references brill transformation-based error-driven learning natural language processing case study part speech tagging. computational linguistics tateisi ohta dong hong jian tsujii genia corpus medline abstracts annotated linguistic information. third meeting text mining intelligent systems molecular biology", "year": 2014}
