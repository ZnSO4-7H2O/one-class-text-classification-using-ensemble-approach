{"title": "Memristive fuzzy edge detector", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.AR", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Fuzzy inference systems always suffer from the lack of efficient structures or platforms for their hardware implementation. In this paper, we tried to overcome this problem by proposing new method for the implementation of those fuzzy inference systems which use fuzzy rule base to make inference. To achieve this goal, we have designed a multi-layer neuro-fuzzy computing system based on the memristor crossbar structure by introducing some new concepts like fuzzy minterms. Although many applications can be realized through the use of our proposed system, in this study we show how the fuzzy XOR function can be constructed and how it can be used to extract edges from grayscale images. Our memristive fuzzy edge detector (implemented in analog form) compared with other common edge detectors has this advantage that it can extract edges of any given image all at once in real-time.", "text": "fig. artiﬁcial neural network proposed mcculloch-pitts implementation logical function. network fig. redrawn usage nano-crossbar structures. ﬁgure shows connection weight matrix treated fuzzy relation. case activation concept input layer select column fuzzy relation output. fig. simulation results ﬁrst conducted experiment. input image. extracted horizontal edges using method. extracted vertical edges proposed system. final output fuzzy function. extracted edges applying ﬁrst steps canny edge detection algorithm. fuzzy inference surface system fig. fig. simulation results second conducted experiment. input images. extracted edges using proposed structure. extracted edges applying ﬁrst steps canny edge detection algorithm. input images degraded gaussian noise. extracted edges noisy input using proposed structure. extracted edges noisy input applying ﬁrst steps canny edge detection algorithm.", "year": 2011}
