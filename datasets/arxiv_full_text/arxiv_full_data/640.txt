{"title": "Can Pretrained Neural Networks Detect Anatomy?", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks demonstrated outstanding empirical results in computer vision and speech recognition tasks where labeled training data is abundant. In medical imaging, there is a huge variety of possible imaging modalities and contrasts, where annotated data is usually very scarce. We present two approaches to deal with this challenge. A network pretrained in a different domain with abundant data is used as a feature extractor, while a subsequent classifier is trained on a small target dataset; and a deep architecture trained with heavy augmentation and equipped with sophisticated regularization methods. We test the approaches on a corpus of X-ray images to design an anatomy detection system.", "text": "convolutional neural networks demonstrated outstanding empirical results computer vision speech recognition tasks labeled training data abundant. medical imaging huge variety possible imaging modalities contrasts annotated data usually scarce. present approaches deal challenge. network pretrained different domain abundant data used feature extractor subsequent classiﬁer trained small target dataset; deep architecture trained heavy augmentation equipped sophisticated regularization methods. test approaches corpus x-ray images design anatomy detection system. deep learning rapidly gaining momentum computer vision speech recognition medical imaging applications record-breaking empirical performance promise jointly learn low-level features high-level decisions directly data. major open research challenge transfer excellent predictive performance methods particular convolutional neural networks data-laden regime computer vision data-bounded regime medical imaging. since typical number parameters models major concern operating data-bounded regimes inability generalize form robust features small number examples capture well variability input space. various approaches deal challenge. data augmentation used increase effective size training drive training build invariances speciﬁc transformations. network architecture design used hard-code prior knowledge design. sophisticated regularization methods dropout batch normalization work counter overﬁtting. finally global training feature extraction layers abundant data domains training classiﬁcation higher layers limited data domains used ensure lower-level features invariant particularities training dataset. choose directions investigate approaches goal anatomy detection x-ray images. ﬁrst using network trained large corpus natural images feature extraction combined classiﬁer trained medical images. second approach using heavy augmentation regularization deep neural network trained small-sized medical image dataset. order assess performance speciﬁcally trained off-the-shelf networks radiographs imageclef medical image annotation task used. challenge database consists broad range x-ray images clinical routine detailed anatomical classiﬁcation. convenience ﬂattened hierarchical class representation disregarded classes fewer example images. ended unique classes. evaluation purposes entire data corpus divided training test covering data respectively. ﬁrst baseline overfeat network combination multi-class employed. overfeat convolutional neural network trained million nonmedical images form imagenet database classes successfully employed generic feature extractor different applications. purpose experiment selected fast overfeat instantiation used default setting feature extraction. results dimensional representation images subsequently used input classier. regularization parameter linear estimated training using exhaustive search -fold cross-validation. second direction designed network inspired work razavian using dropout batch normalization leaky relu activation functions case training used images pixels various augmentations ranging resizing cropping rotation translation shearing stretching ﬂipping. results directions given table investigated when where train convolutional neural network used anatomy detection. results suggest pretrained networks good image descriptors even outside training domain retraining last layer viable alternative perform transfer learning light limited training data. also demonstrated sufﬁciently expressive models deep neural network trained even relatively small number annotations proper augmentation regularization implemented. work ﬁrst step towards multimodality anatomical expert system components trained maximize data efﬁciency.", "year": 2015}
