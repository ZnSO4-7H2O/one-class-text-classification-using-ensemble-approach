{"title": "The Libra Toolkit for Probabilistic Models", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "The Libra Toolkit is a collection of algorithms for learning and inference with discrete probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks, Markov networks, dependency networks, and sum-product networks. Compared to other toolkits, Libra places a greater emphasis on learning the structure of tractable models in which exact inference is efficient. It also includes a variety of algorithms for learning graphical models in which inference is potentially intractable, and for performing exact and approximate inference. Libra is released under a 2-clause BSD license to encourage broad use in academia and industry.", "text": "libra toolkit collection algorithms learning inference discrete probabilistic models
