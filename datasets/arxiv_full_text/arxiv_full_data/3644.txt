{"title": "Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal: A Case Study on an Online Strategy  Game", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Interpersonal relations are fickle, with close friendships often dissolving into enmity. In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where players form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal.  We reveal that subtle signs of imminent betrayal are encoded in the conversational patterns of the dyad, even if the victim is not aware of the relationship's fate. In particular, we find that lasting friendships exhibit a form of balance that manifests itself through language. In contrast, sudden changes in the balance of certain conversational attributes---such as positive sentiment, politeness, or focus on future planning---signal impending betrayal.", "text":

diplomacy—the players communicate form strategies—and orders—the board player operate unit city control. turn pieces option moving adjacent territory. makes diplomacy unique players submit written orders; orders executed simultaneously; randomness thus outcome game depends communication cooperation movements players. units turn territory implies battle. wins battle decided purely based numerical superiority instead moving unit support another unit; large armies created intricate networks support. side largest army wins battle. process supporting unit thus critical successful offensive move successful defense. often lone player lacks units provide enough support attacks thus needs help others. orders machine readable clear indication players working together working deﬁne relationships support come player’s units allies often combine resources. example english army belgium attacking germany army ruhr french army burgundy could strengthen attack. accomplished french player submitting move explicitly stating support england’s attack belgium ruhr. communication diplomacy phase game players talk other. conversations either public or—more typically—one-on-one.
