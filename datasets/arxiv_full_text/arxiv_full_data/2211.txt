levels bear particular responsibility towards mitigating negative eﬀects. senior members academic community also bear responsibility putting current developments historical perspective empower junior researchers pursuing genuine academic interests instead yielding current successes. address policy concern regards focusing attention functions instead also models. biggest concern stems lack

collecting pairs estimating function function need certain applications would qualify model capture system mechanism. modeling mechanism essential early researchers left wealth results ﬁrst-order deduction basically left untouched subject ﬁrst-order model counting heart current needs probabilistic reasoning machine learning. made remarks dinner table included young machine learning researcher. reaction feel much better now. apparently young researcher subjected phenomena supportvector-machine researchers work svms peak considered time. another young vision researcher—when pressed whether deep learning address ambitions vision research—told reality cannot publish vision paper today conference contain deep learning component kind depressing. explanation causal reasoning generally

discussion focuses done model function. pearl’s argument particularly focuses model handle novel scenarios e.g. encountering road blocks invalidate function recommendations pointing combinatorial impossibility encoding contingencies function must bounded size. second reaction received model-based versus function-based perspective workshop dedicated deep learning simons institute workshop title actually representation learning term used increased frequency deep learning researchers. followed presentations deep learning notice critical component getting systems work amounts ﬁnding correct architecture neural network. moreover architectures vary depending task components sometimes portrayed something described intuitive level. reaction deep learning learning function learning representation diﬀerently. architecting structure neural network function engineering representation learning particularly since structure penalized rewarded virtue conformity input-output pairs. outcome function engineering amounts restricting class functions learned using parameter estimation techniques. akin restricting class distributions learned ﬁxes topology probabilistic graphical model. practice representation learning exercise identifying classes functions suitable certain tasks. connection think needed theory cognitive functions. cognitive function captures relationship typically associated cognition mapping audio signals words mapping words meaning. this similar responses given searle’s chinese room argument comes function emulates competence speaking chinese. searle basically missed combinatoric assumption underlying argument. roth alerted another perspective functions versus models based distinction discriminative versus generative learning. particular learning function usually estimate value output variables. however learned model used answer queries reasoning. hector geﬀner made related observation functions perhaps suitable goals ﬁxed. seems needed catalogue cognitive functions study representational complexity addition study learnability approximateability. boolean functions deep theory kind. particular researchers cataloged various functions terms space needed represent diﬀerent forms need something similar real-valued functions meant capture cognitive behaviors. sense already leads theory—for example researchers seem know
