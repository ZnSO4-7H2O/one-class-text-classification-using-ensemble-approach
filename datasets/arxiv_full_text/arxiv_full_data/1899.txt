{"title": "Definition of Visual Speech Element and Research on a Method of  Extracting Feature Vector for Korean Lip-Reading", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "In this paper, we defined the viseme (visual speech element) and described about the method of extracting visual feature vector. We defined the 10 visemes based on vowel by analyzing of Korean utterance and proposed the method of extracting the 20-dimensional visual feature vector, combination of static features and dynamic features. Lastly, we took an experiment in recognizing words based on 3-viseme HMM and evaluated the efficiency.", "text": "defined visemes based vowel analyzing korean utterance proposed method extracting -dimensional visual feature vector combination static features dynamic features. lots researches shows lip-reading plays important role improving speech recognition normal people well expressing phonological expression people paralyzed auditory organ. later researches based analysis process speech discrimination ordinary people explored speaker’s face audio-visual information becomes part audio-visual complex improving encoding speech signal. mcgruk effect arises sense speech signal. mcgruk effect bottom attempt visual information speech recognition. mcgruk effect means stimulated contrary aural visual stimulation recognize nothing. mcgruk effect shows recognized sound depends speech signal also visual information movement. research lip-reading progress parts. first assist

using image processing method linguistic visual features. visemes separated visual feature linguistic ambiguity final recognized result important define viseme. lip-reading convert word sequences viseme sequences ordinary speech recognition based viseme i.e. recognition unit final sentence using recognition model hmm. lip-reading difficult good result speech recognition specialty. reducing

robust fourier transform fourier coefficients feature vector represent type contour method gets extracted geometrical parameters outer inner contour visual feature vector lip-reading change contour usually reflect shape features extracted contour visual features lip-reading. effective region feature represent visual information speech directly. contour based shape features disadvantages features works properly assumption extracted contour region correct contour can’t represent presence tooth state tongue itself. improve performance lip-reading system visual features reflecting many speech information correctly must extracted possible efficient recognition algorithm must used. preceding researches recognition models used speech recognition used lip-reading used conduct regions extracted image frames similar process speech recognition used conduct speech signals. reference proposed method apply lip-reading system. strong classifier used pattern recognition face detection face recognition known highly efficient. movement based lip-reading system viseme defined recognition unit words expressed sequence visemes. viseme viseme based recognition model configured. course define

visemes linguistic ambiguity inversely proportionated visual division ability. words define viseme detail similarly consonants vowels repetition frequency viseme representation words linguistically decreases visual recognition accuracy goes down. unlikely english korean letter composed consonant vowel consonant syllable. consonant vowel consonant syllable certain features visually movement. thus must define viseme using state teeth shape mouse. korean letter composed consonant vowel consonant syllable consonant consonant syllable formed creating obstacle outbreath mouth throat mainly determined state tongue rather shape mouth hard observe. like this general shape mouse presence teeth changed korean vowel consonants consonants syllable except \"pp\" expressed shape mouse presence teeth. information single viseme mainly reflected static feature among static dynamic features reading result static feature image frame shows simple viseme frame represents. visual feature vector
