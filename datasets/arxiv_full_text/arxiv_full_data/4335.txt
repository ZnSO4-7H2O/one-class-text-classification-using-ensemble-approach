{"title": "Data Representation using the Weyl Transform", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "The Weyl transform is introduced as a rich framework for data representation. Transform coefficients are connected to the Walsh-Hadamard transform of multiscale autocorrelations, and different forms of dyadic periodicity in a signal are shown to appear as different features in its Weyl coefficients. The Weyl transform has a high degree of symmetry with respect to a large group of multiscale transformations, which allows compact yet discriminative representations to be obtained by pooling coefficients. The effectiveness of the Weyl transform is demonstrated through the example of textured image classification.", "text": "binary heisenberg-weyl group studied plays important role coding theory paper make connection signal analysis describing weyl transform terms walsh-hadamard transform binary autocorrelations. autocorrelation known powerful tool detecting periodicity imposing shift invariance used variety signal processing tasks including restricted speech coding pitch estimation noise removal applications image processing include character recognition face detection texture classiﬁcation pattern recognition autocorrelation cyclic dyadic latter especially well suited representing multiscale texture. walshhadamard transform also well suited periodic signals since captures binary harmonics data binary counterpart discrete fourier transform combined wiener-khintchine convolution theorem provide fast method calculating dyadic autocorrelation windowed used pattern matching images aforementioned previous work involving autocorrelation extent heuristic develop ﬁrst time rigorous mathematical theory invariance combines notions. fig. illustrates effectively weyl transform able encode differences texture. displays randomly sampled patches different textures. patch broken smaller sub-patches weyl transforms calculated absolute values aggregated sub-patches. fig. displays similarity matrix darker entries indicate greater euclidean distance weyl transforms different patches. adjacent patches form clusters clearly separate textures. section introduces weyl transform invariance property namely absolute values weyl coefﬁcients invariant certain symmetries signal also establish connection weyl transform dyadic autocorrelations section illustrate theory examples real-world textures. demonstrate versatility weyl transform pooling coefﬁcients obtain features additional invariance rotation cyclic translations. also describe supervised learning example training data used select weyl coefﬁcients signiﬁcant distinguishing classes. examples compare approach three state-ofthe-art image representations gabor wavelets examples tested weyl transform regularly outperforms methods using signiﬁcantly shorter feature vector. full proofs results abstract—the weyl transform introduced rich framework data representation. transform coefﬁcients connected walsh-hadamard transform multiscale autocorrelations different forms dyadic periodicity signal shown appear different features weyl coefﬁcients. weyl transform high degree symmetry respect large group multiscale transformations allows compact discriminative representations obtained pooling coefﬁcients. effectiveness weyl transform demonstrated example textured image classiﬁcation. many signal processing tasks detection clustering classiﬁcation rely representations invariant given group transformations. additional invariance transformations permute feature coefﬁcients often achieved pooling coefﬁcients example gabor wavelets scattering transforms focus bases representing signals rather type measurement fundamental widely used algorithms signal processing tasks. thus focus autocorrelation show autocorrelations calculated trace inner products covariance matrices signed permutation matrices discrete heisenberg-weyl group. signal transformed element discrete symplectic group autocorrelations ﬁxed permutation sign change. symplectic group viewed discrete approximation full unitary group large signal length allows great versatility design pooling strategies. approach makes power autocorrelation describing multiscale periodicity signals demonstrate example texture classiﬁcation framework useful signal representation. mapping signal autocorrelation coefﬁcients based heisenberg-weyl group called weyl transform. instance weyl transform special case general framework representation operators harmonic analysis. radar larger framework fundamental study radar ambiguity function calderbank shapiro department electrical engineering duke university usa;
