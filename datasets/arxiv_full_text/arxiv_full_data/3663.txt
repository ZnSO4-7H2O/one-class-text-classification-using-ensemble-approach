The Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge -- ASVSpoof2015 -- provides a standard spoofing database, containing attacks based on synthetic speech, along with a protocol for experiments. This paper describes CPqD's systems submitted to the ASVSpoof2015 Challenge, based on deep neural networks, working both as a classifier and as a feature extraction module for a GMM and a SVM classifier. Results show the validity of this approach, achieving less than 0.5\\% EER for known attacks.", "text": "straightforward application spooﬁng detection classiﬁer whose input data either audio features
