{"title": "Introducing Dendritic Cells as a Novel Immune-Inspired Algorithm for  Anomoly Detection", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells that provide a vital link between the innate and adaptive immune system. Research into this family of cells has revealed that they perform the role of coordinating T-cell based immune responses, both reactive and for generating tolerance. We have derived an algorithm based on the functionality of these cells, and have used the signals and differentiation pathways to build a control mechanism for an artificial immune system. We present our algorithmic details in addition to some preliminary results, where the algorithm was applied for the purpose of anomaly detection. We hope that this algorithm will eventually become the key component within a large, distributed immune system, based on sound immunological concepts.", "text": "abstract. dendritic cells antigen
