In this manner, on a simple system, the evolution of contact states, by parallelization of DDA, has been investigated. So, a comparison between NFIS and SOM results has been presented. The results show applicability of the proposed methods, by different accuracy, on detection of contact's distribution.", "text": "neural networks detection contact state block system. manner simple system evolution contact states parallelization investigated. comparison nfis results presented. results show applicability proposed methods different accuracy detection contact's distribution. words contact detection soft computing environments. interference report consists different answers;
