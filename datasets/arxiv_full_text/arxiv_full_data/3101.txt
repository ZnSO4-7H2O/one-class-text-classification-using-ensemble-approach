{"title": "On the Product Rule for Classification Problems", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We discuss theoretical aspects of the product rule for classification problems in supervised machine learning for the case of combining classifiers. We show that (1) the product rule arises from the MAP classifier supposing equivalent priors and conditional independence given a class; (2) under some conditions, the product rule is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the squared distances to the respective centers of the classes related with different features, such distances being weighted by the spread of the classes; (3) observing some hypothesis, the product rule is equivalent to concatenating the vectors of features.", "text": "discuss theoretical aspects product rule classiﬁcation problems supervised machine learning case combining classiﬁers. show product rule arises classiﬁer supposing equivalent priors conditional independence given class; conditions product rule equivalent minimizing squared distances respective centers classes related different features distances weighted spread classes; observing hypothesis product rule equivalent concatenating vectors features. introduction advance machine learning ﬁeld discovery many different techniques subject combining multiple learners eventually drove attention particular problem combining classiﬁers. many different methods appeared soon compared terms efﬁciency solving problems. product rule present works contexts ranging accuracy different combination rules analytical properties different methods. shown that context handwritten digit recognition product rule performs better combining linear classiﬁers. general however product rule stand competitors problem combining audio video signals guitar-chord recognition product rule better rule problem identity veriﬁcation using face voice proﬁles rule wins theoretical realm shows problems classes product rules equivalent using classiﬁers estimates posteriori probabilities equal one. product rule derived hypothesis conditional statistical independence between different representations data. also intuitive explanations choice product rule instance fact product preferred respect rule enforces qualities deﬁned measures text analytical properties product rule analyzed contexts classiﬁers. show product rule arises classiﬁer supposing equivalent priors conditional independence given class; conditions product rule equivalent minimizing squared distances respective centers classes related different features distances weighted spread classes; observing hypothesis product rule equivalent concatenating vectors features. theoretical facts deﬁnition random variables corresponding distinct feature vectors random variable corresponding class whose output ...ck. function outputs conﬁdence class considering features-variable supposing features product rule classiﬁcation assign provided named could used instead random variables ...x would unnecessarily overload notation. deﬁnition random variable obtained concatenating features density function variable conditioned denote value function point prior probability class supposing gaussian-like classiﬁers covariances parallel axis product rule tries minimize squared distances respective centers classes distances weighted inverse spread classes duin tax. experiments classiﬁer combining rules. int. workshop multiple classiﬁer systems. london kittler hatef duin matas. combining classiﬁers. ieee tpami vol. march zong. classiﬁer combining rules independence assumptions. international conference multiple classiﬁer systems. springer-verlag. berlin heidelberg. according fact product rule arises maximizing posterior hypothesis equivalent priors conditional independence given class. seen that supposing uncorrelation product rule appears well. fact used gaussian classiﬁers i.e. supposed data normally distributed. accordance fact normality uncorrelation implies independency. important consequence fact curse dimensionality. strong evidence conditional joint distribution given class well approximated normal distribution uncorrelated product rule interesting option deal feature vector dimension larger largest dimensions original descriptors. besides product rule allows parallelization. cicconet. guitar human-computer interface. d.sc. thesis. national institute pure applied mathematics. janeiro cicconet carvalho velho. bimodal guitar-chord recognition. international computer music conference. york", "year": 2013}
