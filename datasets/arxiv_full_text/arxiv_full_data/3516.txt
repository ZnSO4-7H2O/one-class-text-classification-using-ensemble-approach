However, the existing solutions require either hardware changes or computationally expansive algorithms. To overcome these limitations, here we propose a novel deep learning approach that interpolates the missing RF data by utilizing the sparsity of the RF data in the Fourier domain. Extensive experimental results from sub-sampled RF data from a real US system confirmed that the proposed method can effectively reduce the data rate without sacrificing the image quality.", "text":
