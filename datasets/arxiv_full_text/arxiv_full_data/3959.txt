{"title": "An Artificial Immune System as a Recommender System for Web Sites", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Artificial Immune Systems have been used successfully to build recommender systems for film databases. In this research, an attempt is made to extend this idea to web site recommendation. A collection of more than 1000 individuals web profiles (alternatively called preferences / favourites / bookmarks file) will be used. URLs will be classified using the DMOZ (Directory Mozilla) database of the Open Directory Project as our ontology. This will then be used as the data for the Artificial Immune Systems rather than the actual addresses. The first attempt will involve using a simple classification code number coupled with the number of pages within that classification code. However, this implementation does not make use of the hierarchical tree-like structure of DMOZ. Consideration will then be given to the construction of a similarity measure for web profiles that makes use of this hierarchical information to build a better-informed Artificial Immune System.",

recommendation original data consists sets site addresses urls taken bookmark collections http//www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/kim/computerimmune. extremely unlikely many people many exact addresses common within profiles. this necessary transform translate addresses different form. number steps necessary widely used site classification tree ontology used called dmoz data pre-processed order remove unwanted information superfluous characters. also includes removing categories user might assigned bookmarks. unfortunately categorisation information cannot kept arbitrary individual person owns bookmarks. instance www.bbc.co.uk could classified ‘media’ person ‘news’ another. addition misclassifications duplications might present data. hence filtering typically yields file partially shown

information internet need automated techniques winnow possibilities also grown only different algorithms proposed literature thus many current collaborative filtering techniques pearson correlation

next section. number possible pitfalls process. example many profiles contain urls created browser program use. users likely delete links reasoning useful stage. create situation artificial similarity users would prevent artificial functioning effectively. therefore still necessary process data used. presents considerable problems. program need devised truncate urls addresses discussed would

furthermore might items together despite fact concerned football. overcome difficulties strategies used within dmoz ontology normalisation reverse partial look-up. first urls undergo kind

alternatively could find closest match number consecutive characters identical counted beginning url. normalisation intelligent matching together overcome first problem mentioned above. overcome

approximately entries whereas dmoz directory categories. sparseness prevent system working since many users might nothing common best categories common vast majority data. furthermore many users entry number categories leading increased similarity since ‘rating’ category same. problems prevent artificial immune system based encoding successful identifying group similar users. another problem using integer category ids. dmoz evolving classification system categories added removed regularly. effect similar categories different integer handed consecutively. instance star wars part four might classified years star wars part might recently entered dmoz system. similar effect seen figure first bookmarks. figure also shows tree structure might prevent problems similar categories still near tree. alternative integer encoding encoding includes tree structure form category address. required similarity measure carefully recognises categories ‘close’ within structure tree. example would need judge parent child sibling relationship similar first cousin grandparent relationship. however constructing measure simple. consider trees figure clear category involved. could lead several subtly different addresses classified category look-up. depending whether truncated sites genuinely different urls could good bad. first case category appear popular whereas second case number category clear

number followed pairs film identification numbers corresponding rating film. target user became antigen whilst current database members potential antibodies. iteration antibodies added artificial immune system. judged similar antigen film ratings concentration increased. unique feature particular approach application idiotypic network theory jerne implemented antibodies concentration reduced. effect creating users similar user quite different thus enhancing recommendation accuracy system. intend site recommender build artificial immune system described section order this also decide encoding user’s profile possibilities. cases user encoded list category number bookmarks within category. difference category ids; either integer reference tree structure. illustrate difference figure shows user’s bookmarks encodings. figures bold indicate many bookmarks fall particular category suppose wish calculate matching coefficient category addresses sample tree diagram figure below. need define ‘edge distance’ number ‘steps’ apart addresses are. example .... edge distance three equates relationship grandparent grandchild strength siblings. staged truncation longer category address obtain match numbers discarded match would strength determined category level matching edge distance user entries categories whilst user entries clearly matches scored highly lower tree indicates precise match. additionally ‘close’ relationships within tree structure count towards match ones separated several ‘generations’ whilst easy users similarity measure increased since entry category question remains afterwards. match discarded counted measure entries user counted entries parent branch comparison user danger discarding matches counted users might ‘perfect’ matches categories first user profile whilst second user another entries. however discard categories already matched another category possible quite high level category might ‘matched’ different entries subcategories another user. might matter since ‘strength’ match would reduced weakness high-level category’s contribution. construct suitable similarity measure artificial immune system produce value scale answers closer indicating closer match. following discussion previous section measure built according following five principles. edge distance affect value overall match? possibility would would smaller value increases. however would work match perfectly would dividing zero. therefore using better. depth matching level affect value overall match? seems useful make level number number integers example above levels. however tree uniform depth. principle matches lower levels score higher since show precise agreement topic matter. however mean perfect match bottom branches score less highly perfect match bottom another lower .....? dmoz database human classification human knowledge. extent classifications arbitrary result pragmatic well epistemological considerations. therefore seems incorrect allow perfect match score occurs lowest level. example might advisable allow perfect matches contribute fully levels remembering match level count zero formula give level effect factor would i.e. level would value level value level profile items whilst match people would seem less valid based profiles containing items. first case entries first profile used proportionately calculating match. assuming profile smaller profile finding fraction would give higher result pairs profiles similar numbers entries however would also give perfect score profiles small number urls urls each. clearly measure ‘reward’ profiles larger number entries. would include number entries. however profiles contain large number entries. analysis data shows users bookmarks likely outliers. hence order produce measure range profiles entries counted though entries. column figure shows calculation measure assumptions above. fifth column figure contains proposed disparity factor. however values column used correction effect would probably stronger original matching score. therefore scaling parameter introduced reduce range disparity factor. parameter determines lowest value range disparity factor take. whilst level would value zero. however would work values greater solve could value cases. thus general matching formula becomes min{ stands level maximum contribution starts. case dmoz reasonable choice cut-off point might level based structure figure disadvantage measure described inherent simplifications using cut-off point matches equally ‘perfect’. smaller cut-off value inaccurate result become. however large branches tree might shallow ever achieve perfect match. furthermore questionable whether linear measure appropriate. hence propose following alternative. matching scores monotonically increasing level close relatively quickly level approaches asymptotically shown figure measure still agrees principle matches lower levels score higher unduly penalise branches contributions potential matches total would divided total number matches transform metric scale. hence similarity measure becomes bentley towards artificial immune system network intrusion detection investigation clonal
