{"title": "Human expert fusion for image classification", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "I.4; I.5"], "abstract": "In image classification, merging the opinion of several human experts is very important for different tasks such as the evaluation or the training. Indeed, the ground truth is rarely known before the scene imaging. We propose here different models in order to fuse the informations given by two or more experts. The considered unit for the classification, a small tile of the image, can contain one or more kind of the considered classes given by the experts. A second problem that we have to take into account, is the amount of certainty of the expert has for each pixel of the tile. In order to solve these problems we define five models in the context of the Dempster-Shafer Theory and in the context of the Dezert-Smarandache Theory and we study the possible decisions with these models.", "text": "image classiﬁcation merging opinion several human experts important different tasks evaluation training. indeed ground truth rarely known scene imaging. propose different models

problem important question image classiﬁcation ﬁeld studied. indeed ground truth rarely known scene imaged; consequently experts provide perception images order train classiﬁers also evaluate image classiﬁcation. real applications experts cannot provide different classes images certitude. moreover difference experts perceptions large many parts images conﬂicting information. thereby expert reality reliable enough experts fusion required. image classiﬁcation generally done local part image classiﬁcation methods usually described three steps. first signiﬁcant features extracted tiles. generally second step necessary order reduce features numerous. third step features given classiﬁcation algorithms. particularity considering small tiles image classiﬁcation sometimes class co-exist tile. example image classiﬁcation process seabed characterization. serves many useful purposes help navigation autonomous underwater vehicles provide data sedimentologists. sonar applications serve examples throughout paper seabed images obtained many imperfections indeed order build images huge number physical data taken account data polluted large amount noises caused instrumentations. addition interferences signal traveling multiple paths speckle fauna ﬂora. therefore sonar images imperfections imprecision uncertainty; thus sediment classiﬁcation sonar images difﬁcult problem. kind applications reality unknown different experts propose different classiﬁcations image. figure exhibits differences interpretation certainty sonar experts trying differentiate type sediment shadow information invisible. color corresponds kind sediment associated certainty expert sediment expressed term sure moderately sure sure. thus order learn automatic classiﬁcation algorithm must take account difference uncertainty expert. example tile rock labeled sure must taken account learning step classiﬁer take account tile another expert says sand? another problem take account tiles sediment? many fusion theories used experts fusion image classiﬁcation voting rules possibility theory belief function theory case experts express certitude perception. result probabilities theories bayesian theory belief function theory adapted. indeed possibility theory adapted imitate imprecise data whereas probability-based theories adapted imitate uncertain data. course possibility probability-based theories imitate imprecise uncertain data time easily. choice conducted belief function theory also called dempster-shafer theory divide fusion approach four steps belief function model parameters estimation depending model combination decision. difﬁcult step presumably ﬁrst belief function model steps follow. moreover real applications image classiﬁcation experts conﬂict large

considered unit belongs class classical belief function theory belief functions also called basic belief assignments deﬁned mapping power onto power closed operator extension proposed dsmt generalized basic belief assignments deﬁned mapping hyper-power onto hyper-power closed operators. consequently manage ﬁnely conﬂict experts also take account tiles class. ﬁrst section discuss present different belief function models based power hyper power set. models answer problem. study models also steps combination decision information fusion. models allow second section general discussion difference dsmt terms capacity represent problem terms decision. finally present illustration proposed experts fusion real sonar images represent particularly uncertain environment. section present models taking

fourth model context dsmt ﬁfth model contexts. simple conditions equation give large panel deﬁnitions belief functions difﬁculties theory. belief functions must therefore chosen according intended application. case space discernment represents different kind sediments sonar images rock sand silt cobble ripple shadow experts give perception belief according certainty. instance expert moderately

consider classes following rock referred sand referred proposed models easily extended study easier understand classes. interpretations expert believes mean expert thinks mean expert thinks also anything ﬁrst interpretation yields hypotheses exclusive second exclusive. study ﬁrst case exclusive. tile expert also provide case propositions expert believes expert believes exclusive. many combination rules proposed last years context belief function theory etc.). context combination rule used today seems conjunctive consensus rule given context dsmt conjunctive consensus rule used want take decision elements rules propose redistribute conﬂict elements. accomplished rule provide given experts decision difﬁcult task. measures able provide best decision cases. generally consider maximum three functions credibility plausibility pignistic probability. credibility function provides pessimist decision plausibility function often optimist. pignistic probability often taken compromise. present three functions models. consider experts providing opinion tile ﬁrst expert says tile rock certainty equal hence ﬁrst expert second expert thinks rock sand considered tile respective certainty hence second expert have illustrate proposed models numerical exemple. model takes account certainty given expert space discernment consider possible heterogeneity given tile consequently another focal element meaning classes context dempster-shafer theory call focal element space discernment given power given belief function provides ambiguity mass rock conﬂict. maximum credibility plausibility pignistic probability ambiguity suppressed functions consider empty set. ﬁrst model possible heterogeneity tile taken account. however ignorance characterized anymore class represents situation classes consequently could equal propose another model given application cannot considered exclusive order propose model following study exclusive classes only. hence application consider space discernment three exclusive classes following notations given ﬁgure build previous section models dsmt case order take account decision considering also fact models model experts models assume exclusive. course assumption false. models take decision credibilities plausibilities pignistic probabilities three functions cannot higher indeed hence ﬁrst problem solved never choose maximum credibility plausibility pignistic probability. experts think considered tile contains rock sand pignistic probabilities equal. however belief highest limits decision rules reached case. seen describe problem dsmt context. dsmt adapted modelize belief example model model provide exactly belief consequently difference expect decision comes combination rules. presented numerical example decisions same choose choose measure always lower measure case classes ignorance usually excluded restrict possible choices singletons etc. therefore equivalent tile credible class plausible probable heaviest focal elements singletons thus classes subspace decision rock consensus rule similar subspace decision rock rule volume differ. higher number classes decision obtained fusing experts’ opinions much less stable left part ﬁgure shows density conﬂict within number classes right part shows distribution changes restrict cases decision changes consensus conﬂict important subspace mostly conﬂict usually means clear decision measure best class often different measure second best class. experts manually segmented images giving kind sediment shadow parts images helped manual segmentation
