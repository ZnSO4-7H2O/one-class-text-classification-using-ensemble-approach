{"title": "Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data: methods and  benchmarks", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML", "stat.OT"], "abstract": "The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X, Y. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37 datasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the \"ground truth\" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best performing methods overall is the additive-noise method originally proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63+-10 % and an AUC of 0.74+-0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of this work we prove the consistency of that method.", "text": "jonas peters planck institute intelligent systems spemannstraße t¨ubingen germany seminar

lifted measure temperature higher point longitude latitude. hand heating cooling location usually change altitude altitudes data range suﬃciently large detect signiﬁcant statistical dependences. potential confounder latitude since mountains south also important factor local climate. places highest average temperatures therefore altitude lying south. hence confounder induce positive correlations altitude temperature opposed negative correlation altitude temperature observed empirically. suggests direct causal relation altitude temperature dominates confounder. known altitude also important factor precipitation since rain often occurs forced rise mountain range becomes oversaturated water lower temperature eﬀect deﬁnes indirect causal inﬂuence altitude precipitation temperature. causal relations however less simple causal inﬂuence altitude temperature gradients altitude respect main direction wind relevant altitude itself. hypothetical intervention would allow validate causal relation could build artiﬁcial mountains observe orographic rainfall. detect causal relation longitude temperature hypothetical intervention could move thermometer west east. even would adjust altitude latitude unlikely temperature would remain since climate west oceanic less continental east germany. therefore longitude causes temperature. sunshine duration altitude slightly positively correlated. possible explanations higher weather stations sometimes low-hanging clouds. cities valleys especially close rivers lakes typically misty days. moving sunshine sensor clouds clearly increases sunshine duration whereas installing artiﬁcial would change altitude. causal inﬂuence altitude sunshine duration confounded instance fact simple statistical dependence altitude longitude germany explained earlier. moving thermometer towards equator generally result increased mean annual temperature. changing temperature hand necessarily result north-south movement thermometer. obvious ground truth latitude causing temperature might somewhat confounded longitude combination selection bias arises including weather stations germany. climate west oceanic less continental east germany expect relationship longitude precipitation. changing longitude moving east-west direction therefore change precipitation even would adjust altitude latitude. hand making rain
