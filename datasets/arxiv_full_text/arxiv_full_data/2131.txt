{"title": "A Critical Examination of RESCAL for Completion of Knowledge Bases with  Transitive Relations", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.DB", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Link prediction in large knowledge graphs has received a lot of attention recently because of its importance for inferring missing relations and for completing and improving noisily extracted knowledge graphs. Over the years a number of machine learning researchers have presented various models for predicting the presence of missing relations in a knowledge base. Although all the previous methods are presented with empirical results that show high performance on select datasets, there is almost no previous work on understanding the connection between properties of a knowledge base and the performance of a model. In this paper we analyze the RESCAL method and prove that it can not encode asymmetric transitive relations in knowledge bases.", "text": "link prediction large knowledge graphs received attention recently importance inferring missing relations completing improving noisily extracted knowledge graphs. years number machine learning researchers presented various models predicting presence missing

performance various natural language processing tasks. relation extraction question answering entity recognition/disambiguation informal domains examples tasks proved invaluable. examples demonstrate increasing recall knowledge bases without compromising precision direct impact several tasks focus research. importance high recall knowledge bases recall even freebase largest open source still quite number researchers published heuristics empirical performance automatically inferring information missing knowledge bases. unfortunately literature theoretical analysis methods still scarce. paper analyze rescal widely cited method inferring missing relations kbs. rescal method embeds entities relations using vectors matrices respectively predicts true status edge nodes using representations. although rescal introduced shown effective variety datasets theoretical analysis failure modes method. show theoretically experimentally rescal suitable predicting missing relations contains transitive asymmetric relations type relation important freebase hypernym relation important wordnet notation knowledge base contains equal collection triples. triple encodes fact subject entity

respectively denote entire collection facts {ek|k rescal rescal model associates entity vector represents relation matrix rd×d. denote entities whose relationship unknown rescal model predicts relation contains relations denotes presence is-a relation denotes absence relation. rescal model follow chain transitive relations infer missing edges using existing information graph triples vertices observed is-a following holds true note general matrix asymmetric score function would also asymmetric i.e. {av|v {mr|r clearly parameterizes rescal. therefore even though embedding used represent entity regardless whether ﬁrst second entity relation rescal model could still handle asymmetric relations matrix asymmetric. transitive relations rescal addition relational information binary connections entities many contain information relations themselves. example consider knowledge base depicted figure based information fluffy is-a is-a animal is-a transitive relations infer missing relations fluffy is-a animal. figure knowledge base containing is-a relations. dashed edges indicate unobserved relations recovered using observed edges fact is-a transitive relation. deﬁne transitive matrix state theorem prove appendix. deﬁnition matrix rd×d transitive every triple vectors satisfy also satisfy theorem every transitive matrix symmetric. enforce constraint equation hold possible vectors ﬁnite number vectors transitive matrix. theorem must symmetric. implies rescal model predicts would also predict terms shown figure rescal model predicts fluffy is-a animal would also predict animal is-a fluffy. therefore rescal model suitable encoding assymmetric transitive relations. analysis section made assumption constraint equation held vectors instead ﬁnite number vector triples. assumption used make conclusions rescal using theorem fair criticism analysis practically rescal model needs encode ﬁnite number vertices vector space possible exists asymmetric matrix correctly make ﬁnite number deductions possible inside ﬁnite could especially true dimensionality rescal embeddings high. hand intuitive number entities inside increases assumptions analysis would become increasingly better approximations reality. therefore performance rescal model degrade number entities inside increases dimensionality embeddings remains constant. order test applicability analysis performed following experiment started complete balanced rooted directed binary tree edges directed root children. augmented follows every tuple distinct vertices added edge already existed directed path starting ending stopped could edges without creating multi-edges. rest paper denote resulting ordered pairs vertices pairs vertices example contains edge root vertex every vertex contains edge every vertex root vertex. tree depth trained rescal model settings ﬁrst setting used entire training inputs rescal model. denote setup fullset. second setting randomly sample select edges denote training setup subset. note however edges including edges original tree always used fullset subset. settings fullset subset trained rescal model times evaluated models’ predictions following three subsets edges introduced earlier. recall contains ordered pairs vertices transitive relation connected contains pairs vertices connected relation. denotes ordered pairs whose reverse pair exists i.e. every edge subsets evaluate model’s performance loss. example evaluate performance rescal edge evaluate whether model assigns higher score reward model point makes right prediction otherwise. before denote presence abscence relationship note performance high performance would indicate exactly kind failure predicted analysis. explained earlier dimensionality rescal embedding number entities signiﬁcantly inﬂuence performance rescal therefore vary tabulate results table upload arxiv table percentage accuracy rescal fullset. every table element triple numbers measuring performance rescal respectively. denotes number nodes tree denotes number dimensions used parameterize entities. wordnet order test analysis real data performed experiments wordnet dataset. wordnet contains vertices called synsets arranged tree like hierarchy relation hyponymy. example hyponym animal animal hyponym living thing therefore hyponym living thing. conduct experiments extracted hyponyms living thing synset tree edges tree form transitive closure under hyponym relation. living thing synset contained hyponyms connected edges performing transitive closure number edges became i.e. performed experiments fullset subset protocols exactly described table results experiments wordnet. speciﬁcally chose subtree rooted living things synset wordnet hierarchy. every synset subtree corresponds vertex. consequently experiments previous works inferring missing information knowledge bases assumes knowledge base graph labeled vertices labeled edges either focus inferring labeled edge used connect previously unconnected vertices learn vertex label/entity type used annotate unlabeled entity. task predicting missing edges focus previously called link prediction knowledge base completion broadly relational machine learning besides before-mentioned papers following publications also present models list without comments terminology used task inferring missing vertex labels focus paper even diverse. task termed class/labeled instance acquisition collective classiﬁcation vertex nomination results table obtained feeding rescal training data. note rescal received possible information training evaluating training accuracy model point. accuracy setting implies model capacity learn rules knowledge base. observe accuracy rescal decreases number entities increases increases dimensionality increases line predictions. also note since much larger therefore training objective rescal favors good performance accordingly accuracy rescal edges remains high performance suffers. high accuracy rescal suggests high enough dimensionality embeddings possible embed ﬁnite database high accuracy. increasing dimensionality rescal embeddings become infeasible extremely large knowledge base. also observe performance rescal degrades number entities inside increases dimensionality embeddings remains constant. results table obtained training rescal subset training method closer embedding based methods usually trained observe accuracy rescal model substantially lower performance either especially upper triangle region table high low. result accordance analysis rescal mode well. results also highlight problem commonly employed evaluation protocol randomly dividing edge graph train test sets measuring knowledge base completion accuracy. example average accuracy quite high accuracy even though subset failure would stay undetected existing evaluation methods. scoring function employed rescal experiments simulated data showed rescal method perform well encoding transitive asymmetric relations speciﬁcally inferences edges reverse edges present knowledge high chance incorrect. although analysis relied somewhat strong assumptions constraint equation holds true points vector space showed insights gained useful practice. idea underlying work knowledge bases considered graphs since also contain logical structure amongst predicates. taking logical structure e.g. constraint vertex connects connects connects logical extreme came well founded argument performance rescal encoding knowledge bases transitive relations. believe idea gainfully used analyze methods well. note theorem ﬁrst proven grinberg give alternative proof. lemma every transitive matrix psd. proof. consider triplet vectors ||b|| either implies three cases lemma rd×d defer proof
