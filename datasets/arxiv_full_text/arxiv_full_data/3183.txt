{"title": "Feature Selection Using Classifier in High Dimensional Data", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Feature selection is frequently used as a pre-processing step to machine learning. It is a process of choosing a subset of original features so that the feature space is optimally reduced according to a certain evaluation criterion. The central objective of this paper is to reduce the dimension of the data by finding a small set of important features which can give good classification performance. We have applied filter and wrapper approach with different classifiers QDA and LDA respectively. A widely-used filter method is used for bioinformatics data i.e. a univariate criterion separately on each feature, assuming that there is no interaction between features and then applied Sequential Feature Selection method. Experimental results show that filter approach gives better performance in respect of Misclassification Error Rate.", "text": "feature selection frequently used pre-processing step machine learning. process choosing subset original features feature space optimally reduced according certain evaluation criterion. central objective paper reduce dimension data finding small important features give good classification performance. applied filter wrapper approach different classifiers respectively. widely-used filter method used bioinformatics data i.e. univariate criterion separately feature assuming interaction features applied sequential feature selection method. experimental results show filter approach gives better performance respect misclassification error rate. input variables modeling problem) grows exponentially. cutting input variable's scale into segments implies single-input model require examples model construction model input variables require forth assuming inputs completely uncorrelated input variables criterion would require million examples. real problems input variables usually somewhat correlated reducing number needed examples problem still explodes rapidly estimates considered somewhat conservative perhaps cell. given issue data miners often faced task selecting predictor variables keep model. process goes several names common subset selection attribute selection feature selection. many solutions proposed task though none perfect except small problems. solutions attack problem directly experimenting predictors kept. applied biology domain technique also called discriminative gene selection detects influential genes based microarray experiments. removing irrelevant redundant features data feature selection helps improve performance learning models filter method filter approach requires statistical analysis feature solving task without utilizing learning model filters work fast using simple measurement result always satisfactory. rapper method wrapper approach involves predetermined learning model selects features measuring learning performance particular learning model. ybrid method hybrid approach attempts take advantage filter wrapper approaches often found that hybrid technique capable locating good solution single technique often traps immature solution. hybrid approach filter models chosen preliminary screening remove redundant irrelevant features f-score information gain. resulted feature sets combined together pre-processed feature fine tuning. step called combination model finally wrapper model applied improve classification accuracy fine-tuning step. stream wise feature selection considers features sequentially adds predictive model. features known advance. thus flexibility stream wise regression provides dynamically decide features generate feature stream provides potentially large savings computation. empirical tests show smaller data sets stepwise regression done hybrid genetic algorithm feature selection introduced called hgafs algorithm selects salient feature subset within reduced size. hgafs incorporates local search operation devised embedded finetune search feature selection process. guide search process newly generated offspring adjusted less correlated features consisting general special characteristics given dataset. thus algorithm reduces redundancy information among selected features. stochastic algorithm based grasp meta-heuristic proposed main goal speeding feature subset selection process basically reducing number wrapper evaluations carry out. grasp multi-start constructive method constructs solution first stage runs improving stage solution. several instances proposed grasp method experimentally tested compared state-of-the-art algorithms high-dimensional datasets. complexity terms wrapper evaluations carried proposed grasp algorithm comes following parameters number predictive variables;
