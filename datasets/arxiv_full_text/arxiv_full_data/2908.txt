With an emphasis on visuo-spatial language, logic, and cognition, the framework supports learning with relational spatio-temporal features identifiable in a range of domains involving the processing and interpretation of dynamic visuo-spatial imagery. We present a prototypical system, and an example application in the domain of computing for visual arts and computational cognitive science.", "text": "abstract. present inductive spatio-temporal
