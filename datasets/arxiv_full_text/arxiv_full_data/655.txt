{"title": "Deep-Plant: Plant Identification with convolutional neural networks", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "This paper studies convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn unsupervised feature representations for 44 different plant species, collected at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England. To gain intuition on the chosen features from the CNN model (opposed to a 'black box' solution), a visualisation technique based on the deconvolutional networks (DN) is utilized. It is found that venations of different order have been chosen to uniquely represent each of the plant species. Experimental results using these CNN features with different classifiers show consistency and superiority compared to the state-of-the art solutions which rely on hand-crafted features.", "text": "although successful must note performance aforementioned solutions highly dependent chosen features task dataset dependent. suffer dataset bias problem paper propose employ deep learning bottom-up top-down manner plant identiﬁcation. former choose convolutional neural networks model learn leaf features means perform plant classiﬁcation. latter rather using black mechanism employ deconvolutional networks visualize learned features. order gain visual understanding features important identify leaf different classes thus avoiding necessity designing hand-crafted features. empirically method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using features learned model classifying different plant species. paper presents contributions. first propose model automatically learn features representation plant categories replacing need designing hand-crafted features previous approaches second identify diagnose feature representation learnt model visualisation strategy based avoid model black solution also provide insight repaper studies convolutional neural networks learn unsupervised feature representations different plant species collected royal botanic gardens england. gain intuition chosen features model visualisation technique based deconvolutional networks utilized. found venations different order chosen uniquely represent plant species. experimental results using features different classiﬁers show consistency superiority compared state-of-the solutions rely hand-crafted features. index terms— plant classiﬁcation deep learning feature plants backbone life earth providing food oxygen. good understanding plants essential help identifying rare plant species order improve drug industry balance ecosystem well agricultural productivity sustainability amongst botanists variations leaf characteristics comparative tool study plants leaf characteristics available observed examined throughout year deciduous annual plants year-round evergreen perennials computer vision despite many efforts conducted plant identiﬁcation still considered challenging unsolved problem. plant nature similar shape colour representation illustrated fig. kumar proposed automatic plant species identiﬁcation system namely leafsnap. identiﬁed plants based curvature-based shape features leaf utilizing integral measure compute functions curvature boundary. then identiﬁcation done nearest neighbours solutions employed geometric multi-scale distance matrix moment invariants colour texture venation features identify plant. model used paper based model proposed ilsvrc dataset used pre-training. rather training architecture re-used pre-trained network recent work reported features extracted activation trained fully supervised manner large-scale object recognition works re-purposed novel generic task;
