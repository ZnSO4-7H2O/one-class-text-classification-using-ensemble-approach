{"title": "Polarimetric SAR Image Segmentation with B-Splines and a New Statistical  Model", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We present an approach for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image region boundary detection based on the use of B-Spline active contours and a new model for polarimetric SAR data: the GHP distribution. In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.", "text": "distribution. order detect boundary region initial bspline curves speciﬁed either automatically manually proposed algorithm uses deformable contours technique model data estimated order transition points between region segmented surrounding area. local algorithm since works region segmented. results performance presented. synthetic aperture radar data proven importance number applications among mentioned forestry agriculture analysis geological geomorphological features thematic updating ocean spills marine climatology monitoring deforestation frery instituto computa¸c˜ao universidade federal alagoas brazil. mejail gambini jacobo-berlles departamento computaci´on universidad buenos aires argentina. active nature sensor images obtained time since illumination source carried sensing device. sensors work microwaves spectrum almost immune adverse weather conditions able penetrate extent surface certain targets. ﬁrst civilian satellite launched followed constellation similar sensors mostly devoted speciﬁc applications cases operated single frequency polarization. shuttle imaging radar-c/x-band launched could operated simultaneously three frequencies able transmit receive horizontal vertical polarization. polarimetric capability provides complete description target polarimetric images multiple complex-valued data sets requiring thus specialized models algorithms. main venues research followed description electromagnetic modeling references therein) statistical laws. follow second one. many techniques proposed feature extraction area classiﬁcation polarimetric imagery. migliaccio present study spill observation means polarimetric data based constant false alarm rate ﬁlter. techniques treat channel individually fuse results approach exploit information images convey. goudail present framework designing algorithms solve detection location segmentation polarimetric images. works authors propose deﬁnition contrast regions diﬀerent polarimetric properties. horta perform polarimetric image classiﬁcation using algorithm. conradsen model polarimetric data complex wishart distribution edge detection. model davison perform classiﬁcation maximum likelihood ferro-famil present segmentation results. distributions used polarimetric approach also based statistical description available information form matrix every pixel. edge ideal curve divides areas diﬀerent polarimetric scattering mechanisms yield diﬀerent statistical properties least available components;
