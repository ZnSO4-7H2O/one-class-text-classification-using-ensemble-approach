Although a lot of prior work considered this problem as a task for learning algorithms, to our knowledge, all of them used small and not clinically realistic data both for training and evaluation of their models. In this work, we explore the limits of this task with a data set coming from over 200,000 breast cancer screening exams. We use this data to train and evaluate a strong convolutional neural network classifier. In a reader study, we find that our model can perform this task comparably to a human expert.", "text": "breast density classiﬁcation essential part breast cancer screening. although prior work

mammographic density reﬂects composition ﬁbroglandular tissue breast seen mammogram. clinical practice united states breast density qualitatively categorized four types almost entirely fatty scattered areas ﬁbroglandular density heterogeneously dense extremely dense. last categories considered dense dense breast tissue common typical ﬁbroglandular breast tissue pattern young women. women years dense breasts. menopause breasts tend contain glands involute. dense breast tissue reduces effectiveness mammography masking effect hide underlying tumor. studies also consistently show increased risk developing breast cancer women high mammographic density compared women mammographic density. masking cancer dense tissue become political issue women requesting supplemental tests dense breasts. currently states mandate women receive notiﬁcation breast density mammography results. signiﬁcant variability radiologist’ assessment breast density computer methods developed improve consistency. them cumulus software program requiring manual input outline measure area breast tissue relative overall breast area recently automated programs developed measure percent density function area volume. several automated density programs demonstrated high reproducibility correlation volumetric density measured however commercially available products involve learning therefore lack ﬂexibility
