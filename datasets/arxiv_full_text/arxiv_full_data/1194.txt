{"title": "Pixel-wise Deep Learning for Contour Detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "We address the problem of contour detection via per-pixel classifications of edge point. To facilitate the process, the proposed approach leverages with DenseNet, an efficient implementation of multiscale convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract an informative feature vector for each pixel and uses an SVM classifier to accomplish contour detection. In the experiment of contour detection, we look into the effectiveness of combining per-pixel features from different CNN layers and verify their performance on BSDS500.", "text": "address problem contour detection per-pixel classiﬁcations edge point. facilitate process proposed approach leverages densenet efﬁcient implementation multiscale convolutional neural networks extract informative feature vector pixel uses classiﬁer accomplish contour detection. experiment contour detection look effectiveness combining per-pixel features different layers verify performance bsds. consider deep nets construct per-pixel feature learner contour detection. task essentially classiﬁcation problem adopt deep convolutional neural networks establish discriminative approach. however subtle deviation typical applications cnns emphasized. method intend architecture e.g. alexnet generate features image pixel single feature vector whole input image. distinction would call different perspective parameter ﬁne-tuning pre-trained per-image imagenet adapted model per-pixel edge classiﬁcations. investigate property features different convolutional layers carry number experiments evaluate effectiveness performing contour detection benchmark bsds segmentation dataset learning features employing deep architecture neural shown effective existing techniques focus yielding feature vector input image design appropriate vision applications require investigating image characteristics pixel level. contour detection central task decide whether underlying pixel edge point not. thus would convenient deep network could yield per-pixel features. extract per-pixel features alexnet using densenet pixel-wise concatenate feed support vector machine classiﬁer. implementation uses densenet feature extraction owing efﬁciency ﬂexibility availability. densenet open source system computes dense multiscale features convolutional layers caffe based object classiﬁer. process feature extraction proceeds follows. given input image densenet computes multiscale versions stitches large plane. processing whole plane cnns densenet would unstitch descriptor planes obtain multiresolution descriptors. dimensions convolutional features ratios image size e.g. one-fourth conv one-eighth conv. rescale feature maps convolutional layers image size. feature vector every pixel. dimension resulting feature vector concatenated conv conv conv conv conv classiﬁcation combined per-pixel feature vectors learn binary linear svm. worth noting that multiscale setting train based original resolution. test time classify test images using original double resolutions. average resulting edge maps ﬁnal output contour detection. test method berkeley segmentation dataset benchmark better assess effects features different layers report respective performance contour detection. bsds dataset contains training validation testing images. boundaries image labeled several workers averaged form ground truth. accuracy contour detection evaluated three measures best f-measure dataset ﬁxed threshold aggregate f-measure dataset best threshold image average precision full recall range prior evaluation apply standard non-maximal suppression technique edge maps obtain thinned edges table features conv contribute most conv conv. suggest lowmid-level features useful contour detection lowesthigher-level features provide additional boost. although features conv conv less effective employed alone achieve best results combining streams. indicates local edge information low-level features object contour information higherlevel features necessary achieving high performance contour detection tasks. arbelaez pablo maire michael fowlkes charless malik jitendra. contour detection hierarchical image segmentation. pattern analysis machine intelligence ieee transactions iandola forrest moskewicz matt karayev sergey girshick ross darrell trevor keutzer kurt. densenet implementing efﬁcient convnet descriptor pyramids. arxiv preprint arxiv. krizhevsky alex sutskever ilya hinton geoffrey imagenet classiﬁcation deep convolutional neural networks. advances neural information processing systems martin david fowlkes charless doron malik jitendra. database human segmented natural images application evaluating segmentation algorithms measuring ecological statistics. computer vision iccv proceedings. eighth ieee international conference volume ieee", "year": 2015}
