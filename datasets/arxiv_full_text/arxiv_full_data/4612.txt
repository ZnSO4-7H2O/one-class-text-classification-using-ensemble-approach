An important issue in hierarchical classification is the evaluation of different classification algorithms, which is complicated by the hierarchical relations among the classes. Several evaluation measures have been proposed for hierarchical classification using the hierarchy in different ways. This paper studies the problem of evaluation in hierarchical classification by analyzing and abstracting the key components of the existing performance measures. It also proposes two alternative generic views of hierarchical evaluation and introduces two corresponding novel measures. The proposed measures, along with the state-of-the art ones, are empirically tested on three large datasets from the domain of text classification. The empirical results illustrate the undesirable behavior of existing approaches and how the proposed methods overcome most of these methods across a range of cases.", "text": "hierarchical

parents; figures respectively. cases hierarchies also cyclic graphs. cases hierarchy imposes parent-child relation among classes implies instance belonging speciﬁc class also belongs without loss generality assume subclass-of relationship among classes cases diﬀerent relationship hold example part-of. assume however three properties always hold relationship. commonly used measures precision recall f-measure accuracy etc. appropriate relations exist among classes. hierarchical performance measure class hierarchy order evaluate properly algorithms. particular must account several diﬀerent types error according hierarchy. example consider tree hierarchy figure assume true class test instance diﬀerent classiﬁcation systems output predicted classes. using evaluation measures systems punished equally error second system severe makes prediction diﬀerent unrelated sub-tree. order measure severity error hierarchical classiﬁcation several interesting issues need addressed. figure presents cases require special handling. cases nodes surrounded circles true classes nodes surrounded rectangles predicted ones. cases sub-grouped pairing problems must select pairs predicted true classes take account calculation error distance-measuring problems concern error calculated pair predicted true classes. figure presents over-specialization error predicted class descendant true

third case called alternative paths presents scenario diﬀerent ways reach true class starting predicted class. case measure could paths order evaluate performance classiﬁcation system. selecting path minimizes distance classes using measure error seems reasonable. figure predicted class ancestor true class alternative paths case also involve multiple paths ancestor descendant predicted class. figure presents scenario common multi-label data. case must decide even measuring error pairs true predicted classes compared. example node could compared node could compared node none; pairings also possible. depending pairings score assigned classiﬁer diﬀerent. seems reasonable pairings minimize classiﬁcation error. example figure could argued prediction based evidence thus compared finally figure presents case predicted class probably matched true class. typically case predicted class true class distant call case long distance problem. pair-based measures assign costs pairs predicted true classes. example figure class could paired class corresponding costs would give total misclassiﬁcation error. ˆyi|i {yj|j sets predicted true classes respectively single test instance sets augmented default predicted default true class respectively corresponding classes used predicted class cannot paired true class vice-versa. example distances predicted class true classes exceed predeﬁned figure interesting cases evaluating hierarchical classiﬁers. nodes surrounded circles true classes nodes surrounded rectangles predicted classes. pair-based measures typically calculate cost pair predicted class true class minimum distance hierarchy e.g. number edges classes along shortest path connects them. intuition closer classes hierarchy similar therefore less severe error. elaborate cost measures assign weights hierarchy’s edges weights decrease moving bottom distance default classes usually ﬁxed large value. constraint states denotes alignment classes either furthermore states default predicted true classes cannot aligned minimum cost minimizes satisfying capacity conservation constraints. quantity minimized networks problem constraints latter problem corresponding capacity constraints explained below. furthermore following integrality theorem states bounds capacity intervals integers exists minimal cost quantity edge also integer pairing problems bipartite graphs represented networks adding nodes source sink edges source ﬁrst nodes second nodes sink sink source. extra nodes edges ensure conservation constraints satisﬁed. pair-based measures thus obtains following network framework setting capacity interval edge expresses possible number pairs predicted true class participate interval pair predicted true classes restricts network

capacity bounds correspond values problem majority existing pair-based measures deals tree hierarchies single-label problems. conditions pairing problem becomes simple single path exists predicted

section example predicted class true classes children figure would paired parent. would either penalized dmax would paired another distant class. propose straightforward extension called multi-label
