{"title": "Regret Bounds for Opportunistic Channel Access", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NI"], "abstract": "We consider the task of opportunistic channel access in a primary system composed of independent Gilbert-Elliot channels where the secondary (or opportunistic) user does not dispose of a priori information regarding the statistical characteristics of the system. It is shown that this problem may be cast into the framework of model-based learning in a specific class of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for which we introduce an algorithm aimed at striking an optimal tradeoff between the exploration (or estimation) and exploitation requirements. We provide finite horizon regret bounds for this algorithm as well as a numerical evaluation of its performance in the single channel model as well as in the case of stochastically identical channels.", "text": "parameter. given current hidden state system control action probability next state given time step chooses action according policy hence observes receives reward without loss resulting policy depends whether system positively correlated negatively correlated details). explain important diﬀerence positively negatively correlated cases represent figure probability condition minθ means distance border policy zone larger hence soon conﬁdence region included policy zone regret tiling algorithm equal exp{−x} according assumption satisﬁes large probability. therefore cx/κ regret bounded value", "year": 2009}
