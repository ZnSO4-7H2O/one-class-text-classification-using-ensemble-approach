{"title": "Symbol Emergence in Robotics: A Survey", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.RO"], "abstract": "Humans can learn the use of language through physical interaction with their environment and semiotic communication with other people. It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form a symbol system and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted on the construction of robotic systems and machine-learning methods that can learn the use of language through embodied multimodal interaction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term, requires an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems and is crucially important. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER is a constructive approach towards an emergent symbol system. The emergent symbol system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory--motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, we suggest future directions of research in SER.", "text": "humans learn language physical interaction environment semiotic communication people. important obtain computational understanding

discovering words continuous speech signals fundamental task children must solve acquire language. unlike automatic speech recognition system children must learn language model i.e. word inventory

experiment simultaneously formed object categories learned related words continuous speech signals continuous visual auditory haptic information i.e. sensory–motor information iterative learning process various word discovery methods enable robots obtain words relationships between words objects. however situations robots currently discover words still limited. simulate robust word discovery process human children real-world environment studies required. powerful design features language called double articulation double articulation enables semiotic code form inﬁnite number meaningful combinations using small number low-level units meaningless inﬁnite ﬁnite elements feature media general referred semiotic economy. speech signals semiotic time-series data considered double

motion segmented several elemental motions e.g. raising knee swinging arm. however elemental motions seem meaningless special names. two-layer hierarchical structure similar existing speech signals. call short-term motion corresponds phoneme segment long-term motion corresponds word chunk. chunk corresponds sequence segments. takano developed large-scale database human whole-body motion modeled
