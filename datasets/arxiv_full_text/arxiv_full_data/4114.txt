It employs an online tracking module for detecting important changes in the evolving trajectory of each vessel across time, and thus can incrementally retain concise, yet reliable summaries of its recent movement. In addition, thanks to its complex event recognition module, this system can also offer instant notification to marine authorities regarding emergency situations, such as risk of collisions, suspicious moves in protected zones, or package picking at open sea. Not only did our extensive tests validate the performance, efficiency, and robustness of the system against scalable volumes of real-world and synthetically enlarged datasets, but its deployment against online feeds from vessels has also confirmed its capabilities for effective, real-time maritime surveillance.", "text": "abstract present system online monitoring maritime activity streaming

next describe sequence vessel positions processed online order detect trajectory movement events thus maintain lightweight synopsis vessel’s course. despite high value maritime surveillance data

station used instead. inevitably transmission delays frequently occur original message arrival. successive positional messages single vessel often arrive intermingled distorted order. figure illustrates out-of-sequence messages numbers signify timestamp values since beginning trajectory. positions retained according order arrival vessel would occasionally appear state sudden agility moving back forth rapidly quite unusual speed. make matters worse networks synchronized clocks. hence vessel within range stations broadcasted message received possibly assigned different transaction timestamp. also happen timestamp assigned different locations vessel. therefore duplicate contradicting positions vessel present collected data. noise might always caused technical issues inherent errors discrepancies positions. also deliberate suspicious actions e.g. switching transponder emitting spoofed coordinates order avoid surveillance sensitive area. extent possible intermittent falsiﬁed positions detected cleared. coping noisy situations data particularly challenging attracted signiﬁcant research interest. argued noise reduction confused anomaly detection data must cleaned advance performing analysis. particular work well-known dbscan clustering algorithm used identify outlier positions could removed dataset. respect time delays adaptive ﬁltering strategy suggested employed kalman ﬁlters monte-carlo simulations sequentially detect delays probabilistically rearrange correct timestamp order. besides stochastic method used cope position spooﬁng exploiting auxiliary
