{"title": "Emotion in Reinforcement Learning Agents and Robots: A Survey", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.HC", "cs.RO", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "This article provides the first survey of computational models of emotion in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research.",

formally introducing computational reinforcement learning categorical emotion theory assumes discrete emotions forming ‘basic’ emotions. ideas frequently inspired work ekman identiﬁed cross-cultural

tendency avoidance helps organism survive dangerous situation accompanied negative feeling prototypical facial expression. however concept ‘basic’ emotions remains controversial within psychology reﬂected dimensional emotion theory assumes underlying aﬀective space. space involves least dimensions; usually valence arousal example fear highly arousing negative aﬀective state. theory originally developed ‘core aﬀect’ model i.e. describing long-term underlying emotional state. osgood orginally added dominance third dimension resulting model. dimensional models diﬃculty separating emotion categories anger disgust common critique theory. finally componential emotion theory best known cognitive appraisal theory considers emotions results evaluations incoming stimuli according personal relevance. examples frequently occurring appraisal dimensions valence novelty goal relevance goal congruence coping potential. distinct emotions relate speciﬁc patterns appraisal activation. example anger result evaluating situation harmful one’s goals emotion attributed responsible actor least feeling power. well-known appraisal theories basis computational models model component process theory

aﬀective responses relation behaviour learning also extensively studied neuroscience; survey discuss theories ledoux damasio rolls. work ledoux mainly focussed role amygdala fear conditioning. ledoux identiﬁed incoming sensory stimuli directly move thalamus amygdala thereby bypassing previously assumed intermediate step neo-cortex. such work showed emotional responses also elicited without neo-cortical reasoning. damasio took diﬀerent perspective rational emotions ‘somatic marker hypothesis’. proposes emotions result bodily sensations tell organism current sensations beneﬁcial harmful somatic marker therefore signal later work rolls shifted attention amygdala orbitofrontal cortex imaging studies implicated reinforcement aﬀect direct input connections sensory channels projecting several brain areas involving motor behaviour autonomic responses also single neuron studies shown visual taste signals converge neurons coined ’conditional reward neurons’. earlier work already

reward provides better task achievement compared non-intrinsically motivated agents discuss implementations based ideas extensively marinier laird sequeira work marinier laird takes diverse appraisal dimensions based scherer’s appraisal theory include sensory processing dimensions like suddenness intrinsic pleasantness relevance comprehension reasoning dimensions like outcome probability discrepancy expectation conduciveness control power. implementation sequeira uses smaller subset appraisal dimensions novelty relevance valence control. note appraisal-based papers elicit appraisal dimensions without specifying categorical dimensional emotions highlight appraisal implementations concretize speciﬁcation mdps illustrate diﬀerences models. sequeira speciﬁes ‘motivational relevance’ inversely related distance goal. implement planning procedure model returns several speciﬁcations intrinsic motivation literature reﬂect appraisal dimensions. example hester stone maintain ensemble

psychologist could seek results planning literature develop verify psychological theory well. several implementations appraisal dimensions e.g. lee-johnson williams kwon hasson moussa magnenat-thalmann also encounter explicit social dimensions like social fairness social accountability although latter example requires symbolic reasoning paradigm. illustrates current algorithms trouble learning complex social phenomena. appraisal systems also include homeostatic variables williams lee-johnson mention appraisal paper dimensions conceptualized intrinsic motivation

challenge ﬁeld here namely translate abstract cognitive concepts explicit mathematical expressions. third branch emotion elicitation methods focusses value reward functions. generally identify four groups value-based temporal diﬀerence-based average reward-based reward-based earliest approaches sequential decision making based emotion bozinovski bozinovski considered emotion expected cumulative reward received taking action state. thereby bozinovski actually developed precursor q-learning grounded emotional ideas. implementations also considered emotion state value. example matsuda maintains separate value function fear updated agent gets penalized. recent work jacobs considers positive negative part state hope fear signal. another value-based approach salichs malfaz model fear particular state worst historical q-value associated state. such model remembers particular locations afraid. extensive research neuroscience connection dopamine following ideas also implementations connecting happiness unhappiness positive negative respectively models based temporal diﬀerence robust shifting reward function constant recently moerland extended ideas deriving hope fear signals anticipated temporal diﬀerences another branch emotion derivations base average reward. example broekens schweighofer doya hogewoning derive valence ratio shortlongterm average reward. also derives emotions temporal change reward function blanchard canamero uses average reward. implementations interpreted reward ifself emotional signal conclusion emotions related value function temporal difference error direct derivative reward function note implementations incorporate time dimensions well e.g. moerland salichs malfaz broekens table overview elicitation methods based value and/or reward functions. implementations either based value function temporal diﬀerence error derivative average reward reward function. implementations detected emotional state another person inﬂuence emotion agent/robot hasson uses facial expression recognition systems detect human emotion kubota wakisaka uses human speech input. note agent emotions subsequently inﬂuence agent learning come close learning human emotional feedback several implementations pre-specify sensation-emotion connections. general approaches less generic compared earlier categories. example fuzzy logic rules connect input emotions another example encountered previous emotional state example markovian transition model emotions similar ideas reasonable idea smoother emotion dynamics still categorize hard-wired since explain initial emotions generated. finally also overlap previously described elicitation methods. example tsankova derives emotion directly collision detector. similar homeostatic speciﬁcations tsankova
