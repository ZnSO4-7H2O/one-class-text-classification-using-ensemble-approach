{"title": "A review and comparison of strategies for multi-step ahead time series  forecasting based on the NN5 forecasting competition", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "stat.AP"], "abstract": "Multi-step ahead forecasting is still an open challenge in time series forecasting. Several approaches that deal with this complex problem have been proposed in the literature but an extensive comparison on a large number of tasks is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing existing strategies for multi-step ahead forecasting and comparing them in theoretical and practical terms. To attain such an objective, we performed a large scale comparison of these different strategies using a large experimental benchmark (namely the 111 series from the NN5 forecasting competition). In addition, we considered the effects of deseasonalization, input variable selection, and forecast combination on these strategies and on multi-step ahead forecasting at large. The following three findings appear to be consistently supported by the experimental results: Multiple-Output strategies are the best performing approaches, deseasonalization leads to uniformly improved forecast accuracy, and input selection is more effective when performed in conjunction with deseasonalization.", "text": "considering algorithm generate query predictions obtained diﬀerent number neighbors. predictions testing error {eloo eloo eloo} calculated. note variant mimo forecasting strategy selection criteria. variant mimo forecasting strategy autocorrelation selection criteria. dirmo forecasting strategy select best value parameter variant dirmo strategy calculates simple average forecasts obtained diﬀerent values parameter dirmo-avg weighted average weights inversely proportional testing errors. table pre-competition phase. average forecasting errors average ranking strategy diﬀerent conﬁgurations. numbers round bracket represent ranking within column. table competition phase. average forecasting errors average ranking strategy diﬀerent conﬁgurations. numbers round bracket represent ranking within column.", "year": 2011}
