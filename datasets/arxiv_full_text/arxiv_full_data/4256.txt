{"title": "Pose Flow: Efficient Online Pose Tracking", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Multi-person articulated pose tracking in complex unconstrained videos is an important and challenging problem. In this paper, going along the road of top-down approaches, we propose a decent and efficient pose tracker based on pose flows. First, we design an online optimization framework to build association of cross-frame poses and form pose flows. Second, a novel pose flow non maximum suppression (NMS) is designed to robustly reduce redundant pose flows and re-link temporal disjoint pose flows. Extensive experiments show our method significantly outperforms best reported results on two standard Pose Tracking datasets (PoseTrack dataset and PoseTrack Challenge dataset) by 13 mAP 25 MOTA and 6 mAP 3 MOTA respectively. Moreover, in the case of working on detected poses in individual frames, the extra computation of proposed pose tracker is very minor, requiring 0.01 second per frame only.", "text": "multi-person
