{"title": "Augmented Robust PCA For Foreground-Background Separation on Noisy,  Moving Camera Video", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "This work presents a novel approach for robust PCA with total variation regularization for foreground-background separation and denoising on noisy, moving camera video. Our proposed algorithm registers the raw (possibly corrupted) frames of a video and then jointly processes the registered frames to produce a decomposition of the scene into a low-rank background component that captures the static components of the scene, a smooth foreground component that captures the dynamic components of the scene, and a sparse component that can isolate corruptions and other non-idealities. Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm produces a panoramic low-rank component that spans the entire field of view, automatically stitching together corrupted data from partially overlapping scenes. The low-rank portion of our robust PCA model is based on a recently discovered optimal low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink) that requires no parameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on both static and moving camera videos corrupted by noise and outliers.", "text": "total variation -based regularization model spatial continuity foreground. non-static background case rpca-based model proposed iteratively estimates decomposition along parameters afﬁne transformation model describes motion frames;
