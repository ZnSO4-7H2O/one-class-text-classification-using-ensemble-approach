{"title": "Objective Variables for Probabilistic Revenue Maximization in  Second-Price Auctions with Reserve", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.GT", "cs.LG", "stat.AP"], "abstract": "Many online companies sell advertisement space in second-price auctions with reserve. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic method to learn a profitable strategy to set the reserve price. We use historical auction data with features to fit a predictor of the best reserve price. This problem is delicate - the structure of the auction is such that a reserve price set too high is much worse than a reserve price set too low. To address this we develop objective variables, a new framework for combining probabilistic modeling with optimal decision-making. Objective variables are \"hallucinated observations\" that transform the revenue maximization task into a regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem, which we solve with an EM algorithm. This framework enables a variety of prediction mechanisms to set the reserve price. As examples, we study objective variable methods with regression, kernelized regression, and neural networks on simulated and real data. Our methods outperform previous approaches both in terms of scalability and profit.", "text": "many online companies sell advertisement space second-price auctions reserve. paper develop probabilistic method learn proﬁtable strategy reserve price. historical auction data features predictor best reserve price. problem delicate—the structure auction reserve price high much worse reserve price low. address develop objective variables framework combining probabilistic modeling optimal decision-making. objective variables hallucinated observations transform revenue maximization task regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem solve algorithm. framework enables variety prediction mechanisms reserve price. examples study objective variable methods regression kernelized regression neural networks simulated real data. methods outperform previous approaches terms scalability proﬁt. many online companies earn money auctions selling advertisement space items. widely used auction paradigm second-price auctions reserve paradigm company sets reserve price minimal price willing sell potential buyers cast bids. highest smaller reserve price transaction;
