{"title": "Density Weighted Connectivity of Grass Pixels in Image Frames for  Biomass Estimation", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the biomass of roadside grasses plays a significant role in applications such as fire-prone region identification. Current solutions heavily depend on field surveys, remote sensing measurements and image processing using reference markers, which often demand big investments of time, effort and cost. This paper proposes Density Weighted Connectivity of Grass Pixels (DWCGP) to automatically estimate grass biomass from roadside image data. The DWCGP calculates the length of continuously connected grass pixels along a vertical orientation in each image column, and then weights the length by the grass density in a surrounding region of the column. Grass pixels are classified using feedforward artificial neural networks and the dominant texture orientation at every pixel is computed using multi-orientation Gabor wavelet filter vote. Evaluations on a field survey dataset show that the DWCGP reduces Root-Mean-Square Error from 5.84 to 5.52 by additionally considering grass density on top of grass height. The DWCGP shows robustness to non-vertical grass stems and to changes of both Gabor filter parameters and surrounding region widths. It also has performance close to human observation and higher than eight baseline approaches, as well as promising results for classifying low vs. high fire risk and identifying fire-prone road regions.", "text": "aschool engineering technology central queensland university brisbane australia bdepartment transport main roads emerald queensland australia where fuel load grasses within sampling region number grass stems region indicates length stem stands fuel load unit stem. fuel load averaged stems. number rows columns respectively column vector target automatic grass biomass estimation find projection solution capable transferring properties image column vectors estimated fuel load physically quantified fuel load field surveys make assumptions grass stems analogously represented columns image pixels fuel load unit equal stems type vegetation. although first assumption strictly correct method field surveys. specifically proposed approach calculates three consecutive steps including measuring length column weighting length grass density surrounding columns integrating weighted lengths where mapping function image pixels column scalar representing length grass stem column mapping function weighted lengths estimated fuel load fig. examples showing differences classification results grass pixels dominant vertical orientation high dense grasses sparse grasses. grass pixels vertical orientation represented white color. densely high grasses longer connectivity along vertical horizontal orientations sparely grasses implies importance height density. fig. framework proposed dwcgp approach. sampling image window approach first classifies grass non-grass pixels detects vertical non-vertical dominant orientation every pixel. calculation dwcgp based connectivity grass pixels along vertical orientation column grass density surrounding region column. extracted color texture features input layer receives input performs multiplication addition operations based weights constants finally transfers calculated values using linear non-linear activation function where transferred output trained weights constants. indicates activation function tangent sigmoid. values taken input neurons hidden layer similar operations performed hidden layer output layer. finally output layer produces probability using linear activation function indicates likelihood brown grasses pixel coordinates decision label pixel made based sampling window first obtain grey version replacing pixel average values. assume gabor filter orientation scale responses calculated convolving filter intensities pixels assume {grass;
