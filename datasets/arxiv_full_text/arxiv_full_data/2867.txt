Characterization (amplitude and phase) of these pulses is a key ingredient in ultrafast science, e.g., exploring chemical reactions and electronic phase transitions. Here, we propose and demonstrate, numerically and experimentally, the first deep neural network technique to reconstruct ultra-short optical pulses. We anticipate that this approach will extend the range of ultrashort laser pulses that can be characterized, e.g., enabling to diagnose very weak attosecond pulses.", "text": "ultra-short laser pulses
