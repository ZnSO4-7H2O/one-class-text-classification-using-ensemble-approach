{"title": "Fuzzy Dynamical Genetic Programming in XCSF", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "cs.SY", "I.2.6"], "abstract": "A number of representation schemes have been presented for use within Learning Classifier Systems, ranging from binary encodings to Neural Networks, and more recently Dynamical Genetic Programming (DGP). This paper presents results from an investigation into using a fuzzy DGP representation within the XCSF Learning Classifier System. In particular, asynchronous Fuzzy Logic Networks are used to represent the traditional condition-action production system rules. It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution to design an ensemble of such fuzzy dynamical systems within XCSF to solve several well-known continuous-valued test problems.", "text": "continuous dynamical systems known fuzzy logic networks generalization boolean functions replaced fuzzy logical functions fuzzy theory. paper explore asynchronous representation scheme within xcsf learning classiﬁer system show possible extend continuous-valued domain. following modiﬁcations made discrete scheme used accommodate continuous-actions fuzzy logical functions. here node’s function represented integer references appropriate operation execute upon received inputs further node’s connectivity represented list kmax integers range represents input received connection. integer connection list along node function subjected mutation reproduction self-adapting rate rule. output nodes provide real numbered output range averaging used order preserve crisp output however given value less match node regardless state outputs rule join building standard built selecting single classiﬁer adding matching classiﬁers whose actions within predetermined range rule’s proposed action parameters updated usual however similar xcsf ﬁtness adjustment takes place executed usual exploitation functions selecting single rule highest prediction multiplied accuracy following extra prediction weight receives input classiﬁer’s action included. addition prediction weights oﬀspring reset upon reproduction prevent inexperienced rules chosen exploitation. abstract number representation schemes presented within learning classiﬁer systems ranging binary encodings neural networks recently dynamical genetic programming paper presents results investigation using fuzzy representation within xcsf learning classiﬁer system. particular asynchronous fuzzy logic networks used represent traditional condition-action production system rules. shown possible self-adaptive open-ended evolution design ensemble fuzzy dynamical systems within xcsf solve several well-known continuousvalued test problems. recently investigated dynamical genetic programming representation scheme within learning classiﬁer systems shown able evolve ensembles random boolean networks solve number discrete-valued computational tasks. additionally shown possible exploit memory existing inherently within representation. moreover networks updated asynchronously potentially realistic model genetic regulatory networks general. fuzzy theory generalization boolean logic continuous variables partially belong sets. fuzzy deﬁned membership function typically within range determines degree belonging value set. presented form xcsf action computed directly linear combination input state vector action weights conducted experimentation continuous-action frog problem selecting classiﬁer highest prediction exploitation. subsequently extended adapting action weights problem evolution strategy reported greater performance averaged number trials superior performance reported recently applied fuzzy-lcs continuous vector actions evolved action parts fuzzy systems continuous-action frog problem achieved lower error q-learning trials frog problem single-step problem nonlinear continuous-valued payoﬀ function continuous onedimensional space range frog given learning task jumping catch distance frog frog receives sensory input jumping chosen distance receiving reward based distance given parameters used used fig. illustrates performance fdgp-xcsf continuous-action frog problem. seen greater performance achieved fewer trials faster minimal changes resulting none drawbacks;
