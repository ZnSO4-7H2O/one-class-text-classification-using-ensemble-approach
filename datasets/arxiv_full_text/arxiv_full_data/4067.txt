{"title": "Object Recognition with Imperfect Perception and Redundant Description", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper deals with a scene recognition system in a robotics contex. The general problem is to match images with <I>a priori</I> descriptions. A typical mission would consist in identifying an object in an installation with a vision system situated at the end of a manipulator and with a human operator provided description, formulated in a pseudo-natural language, and possibly redundant. The originality of this work comes from the nature of the description, from the special attention given to the management of imprecision and uncertainty in the interpretation process and from the way to assess the description redundancy so as to reinforce the overall matching likelihood.", "text": "paper deals scene recognition system robotics problem scriptions. identifying vision ulator human operator description language inality description given management uncertainty interpretation description dancy reinforce likelihood. robotics context achieves mantic descriptions decision tions nition priori descriptions; high level language without type problem. dubois jaulent's methods described mensionnal coverings probabilities assumptions often verified. ness exhaustiveness independence hypothesis. data determine conditional approach segmentation obtained cations. belief within framework lower probabilities ping. theory introduces ptobability problems proach. complexity. malization counter-intuitive iments realized reasoning events scene interpretation possibility framework imprecise main features faithfulness data convenient press aggregate bination. last aspect independence uncertainty interpretation. ject geometry contrary pendent attractive combination combination reliability information. gained popularity fusion uncertainty sion. scene interpretation often uncertain and/or imprecise. percepts precise identify tainty. contain environment description natural fact value variable eration singleton. lack complete certain able given subset. importance uncertainty pretation system. different able modeling theory sibility relations topological. order obtain composed native definition tions described ditions. objects concerns lated relation; could correspond sufficient /jj' denotes known spatial tween iii' rn.ii'. then possible o;.rn..oi') rn.)) part \"des\" .rn.oi' could seen scene ji'· recognition lations \"des\". first chose classic number objects strong mode fidence degrees contradictory possible tant bring reinforcement inference recognition introduce first time worked combination reinforcement choice tion general matching information description simply posed present several reasons perfectly description cause operator world objects appear information sensors instance jects sensor data processing objects given). unfortunately rules informa­ matching tion matched given description; usually behavior instance finding object found good fairly approaches forcement rules without allowed. consider much sensor provided information used. quite simple intuitive difficulty raises applying principle. mentioned individual items perfectly rec­ ognized; then permanent dilemma declaring i.e. reducing sub-description. pattern matching problem redundant proto­ type fact two-criterion problem minimizing redundancy maximizing matching performance ered basic domain-dependent matching algo­ rithm redundancy general concept clarified. given matching candidate call used dundancy items discarded order assess whether contraction abusive redundancy com­ pared number redundant items user introduced initial call description instance user provided recognition sys­ items description redundant means user found quite likely matched either erroneous matching percepts difficult sense. con­ sequently soon system matches correctly items mismatching crease matching performance gation rules redundancy known. course user could required post information however seems possible derive basic matching algorithm behav­ imagine items discarded then basic matching algorithm output better likelihood worse non-ambiguity. limit item removed performance ment non-ambiguity called kernel result matching correct assume initial description initial informa­ tion consider matching candidate given preceding considerations description basic matching algorithm. classically matching performance vidual items matching performance. matching algorithm domain-dependent reasonable ones number items least likelihood least assume contains items find matching candidate contains items. assume find items strictly non-ambiguity. take account best individual matchings among ones implies. assessing non-ambiguity look best subl different matching compare likeli­ hood", "year": 2013}
