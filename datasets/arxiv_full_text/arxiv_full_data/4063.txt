{"title": "Artificial Neural Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) For Brain Tumor  Detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Detection and segmentation of Brain tumor is very important because it provides anatomical information of normal and abnormal tissues which helps in treatment planning and patient follow-up. There are number of techniques for image segmentation. Proposed research work uses ANFIS (Artificial Neural Network Fuzzy Inference System) for image classification and then compares the results with FCM (Fuzzy C means) and K-NN (K-nearest neighbor). ANFIS includes benefits of both ANN and the fuzzy logic systems. A comprehensive feature set and fuzzy rules are selected to classify an abnormal image to the corresponding tumor type. Experimental results illustrate promising results in terms of classification accuracy. A comparative analysis is performed with the FCM and K-NN to show the superior nature of ANFIS systems.", "text": "ntensity based hence accuracy low. warfield combined elastic atlas registration
