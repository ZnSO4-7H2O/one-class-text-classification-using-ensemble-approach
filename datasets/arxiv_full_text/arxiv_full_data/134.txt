{"title": "Mesh Learning for Classifying Cognitive Processes", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "A relatively recent advance in cognitive neuroscience has been multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), which enables researchers to decode brain states and/or the type of information represented in the brain during a cognitive operation. MVPA methods utilize machine learning algorithms to distinguish among types of information or cognitive states represented in the brain, based on distributed patterns of neural activity. In the current investigation, we propose a new approach for representation of neural data for pattern analysis, namely a Mesh Learning Model. In this approach, at each time instant, a star mesh is formed around each voxel, such that the voxel corresponding to the center node is surrounded by its p-nearest neighbors. The arc weights of each mesh are estimated from the voxel intensity values by least squares method. The estimated arc weights of all the meshes, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs), are then used to train a classifier, such as Neural Networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Na\\\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The proposed Mesh Model was tested on neuroimaging data acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a recognition memory experiment using categorized word lists, employing a previously established experimental paradigm (\\\"Oztekin & Badre, 2011). Results suggest that the proposed Mesh Learning approach can provide an effective algorithm for pattern analysis of brain activity during cognitive processing.", "text": "relatively recent advance cognitive neuroscience multi-voxel pattern analysis enables researchers decode brain states and/or type information represented brain cognitive operation. mvpa methods utilize machine learning algorithms distinguish among types information cognitive states represented brain based distributed patterns neural activity. current investigation propose approach representation neural data pattern analysis namely mesh learning model. approach time instant star mesh formed around voxel voxel corresponding center node surrounded p-nearest neighbors. weights mesh estimated voxel intensity values least squares method. estimated weights meshes called mesh descriptors used train classifier neural networks k-nearest neighbor na√Øve bayes support vector machines. proposed mesh model tested neuroimaging data acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging recognition memory experiment using categorized word lists employing previously established experimental paradigm results suggest proposed mesh learning approach provide effective algorithm pattern analysis brain activity cognitive processing. figure illustration mesh learning approach. first step; find p-nearest neighbor voxel using spatial distance measure. second step; form local mesh around voxel star topology surrounding voxels pnearest neighbors center voxel mesh defined voxel form feature space classifier. third step; weights center voxel neighbors mesh estimated linear regression model voxel intensity values time instant fourth step; center voxel p-dimensional vector formed entries estimated weights. fifth step; time instant weight vector voxels concatenated dimensional vector number active voxels. figure spatio-temporal distributions voxel intensity values spatial dimension. voxels distributed x-axis y-axis z-axis time axis indicates fmri intensity values different classes. fmri intensity values quantized levels indicated color visualization purposes. category animal. distribution directions distribution directions distribution directions. intensity values quantized levels visualize voxel intensity distribution using color.", "year": 2012}
