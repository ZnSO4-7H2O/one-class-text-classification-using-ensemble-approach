It supports structured Support Vector Machines and structured Perceptron. The library consists of a core learning module and several applications, which can be executed from command-lines. Documentation is provided to guide users. In Comparison to other structured learning libraries, IllinoisSL is efficient, general, and easy to use.", "text": "illinoissl java library learning structured prediction models. supports structured support vector machines structured perceptron. library consists core learning module several applications executed command-lines. documentation provided guide users. comparison structured learning libraries illinoissl eﬃcient general easy use. structured prediction models widely used several ﬁelds ranging natural language processing computer vision bioinformatics. make structured prediction accessible practitioners present illinoissl java library implementing structured prediction models. library supports fast parallelizable variants commonly used models like structured support vector machines structured perceptron allowing users multiple cores train models eﬃciently. experiments part-of-speech tagging show models implemented illinoissl achieve level performance svmstruct well-known implementation structured one-sixth training time. best knowledge illinoissl ﬁrst fully self-contained structured learning library java. library released ncsa licence providing freedom using modifying software. agreement number fa---. u.s. government authorized reproduce distribute reprints governmental purposes notwithstanding copyright notation thereon. views conclusions contained herein authors interpreted necessarily representing oﬃcial policies endorsements either expressed implied darpa u.s. government. illinoissl provides generic interface building algorithms learn data. developer needs deﬁne input output structures specify underlying model inference algorithm then parameters model estimated learning algorithms provided library. generality interface allows users switch seamlessly several learning algorithms. feature vector extracted input output constraints force model assign higher score correct output strcture others. slack variable loss penalize violation objective function illinoissl supports algorithms solve dual coordinate descent method parallel algorithm demidcd illinoissl also provides implementation structured perceptron step structured perceptron updates model using training instance maxy∈yi learning abstractinfsolver provides method solving inference loss-augmented inference method evaluating loss example tagging class include implementations viterbi decoder hamming loss respectively. learning algorithms. ready-to-use implementations. illinoissl package contains implementations several common tasks including sequential tagger cost-sensitive mulcticlass classiﬁer dependency parser. table shows implmentation details learners. implementations provide users ability easily train model common problems using command lines also serve examples using library. readme provides details library. documentation. illinoissl comes detailed documentations including java command-line usage tutorial. tutorial provides step-by-step instructions building tagger lines java code. users post comments questions package toto illinois-ml-nlp-userscs.uiuc.edu. part-of-speech tagging problem. follow settings chang conduct experiments english penn treebank bank svmstruct solves l-loss structured problem using cutting-plane method seqlearn implemented structured perception algorithm sequential tagging problem. illinoissl cores train structured model. default parameters used. figure shows accuracy along training time model default parameters. despite general-purpose package illinoissl eﬃcient others. also implemented minimum spanning tree based dependency parser using illinoissl api. implementation done less lines code hours coding eﬀort. figure shows performance system accuracy head words illinoissl competitive mstparser popular implementation dependency parser.", "year": 2015}
