{"title": "Challenging Images For Minds and Machines", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "There is no denying the tremendous leap in the performance of machine learning methods in the past half-decade. Some might even say that specific sub-fields in pattern recognition, such as machine-vision, are as good as solved, reaching human and super-human levels. Arguably, lack of training data and computation power are all that stand between us and solving the remaining ones. In this position paper we underline cases in vision which are challenging to machines and even to human observers. This is to show limitations of contemporary models that are hard to ameliorate by following the current trend to increase training data, network capacity or computational power. Moreover, we claim that attempting to do so is in principle a suboptimal approach. We provide a taster of such examples in hope to encourage and challenge the machine learning community to develop new directions to solve the said difficulties.", "text": "denying tremendous leap performance machine learning methods past half-decade. might even speciﬁc sub-ﬁelds pattern recognition machine-vision good solved reaching human super-human levels. arguably lack training data computation power stand solving remaining ones. position paper underline cases vision challenging machines even human observers. show limitations contemporary models hard ameliorate following current trend increase training data network capacity computational power. moreover claim attempting principle suboptimal approach. provide taster examples hope encourage challenge machine learning community develop directions solve said difﬁculties. known outside academia machine-learning become ubiquitous popular media industry. superhuman capabilities gradually recorded various ﬁelds game face veriﬁcation image categorization even logical reasoning simple scenes current leading methods involve variant deep learning. consequentially require large amounts hand-labeled data used self-play gain experience). elicited data-hungry increasingly large-scale datasets painstakingly labeled object classiﬁcation/detection/segmentation image annotation visual question-answering pose estimation name few. accompanied growing demand computational power. bring forward challenges vision seem solved current methods importantly current popular methodologies meaning neither additional data added computational power drivers solution. figure children’s puzzle goal hidden words book words story pages read novel. machine child’s play. could solved providing million similar examples deep-learning system?
