The recently introduced `neural-style' algorithm substantially succeeds in merging the perceived artistic style of one image or set of images with the perceived content of another. In light of this and other recent developments in image analysis via convolutional neural networks, we investigate the effectiveness of a `neural-style' representation for classifying the artistic style of paintings.", "text": "artistic style painting subtle aesthetic judgment used historians grouping classifying artwork. recently introduced ‘neural-style’ algorithm substantially succeeds
