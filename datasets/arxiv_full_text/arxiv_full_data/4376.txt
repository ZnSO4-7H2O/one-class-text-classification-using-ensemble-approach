{"title": "Deep Learning Algorithms for Signal Recognition in Long Perimeter  Monitoring Distributed Fiber Optic Sensors", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In this paper, we show an approach to build deep learning algorithms for recognizing signals in distributed fiber optic monitoring and security systems for long perimeters. Synthesizing such detection algorithms poses a non-trivial research and development challenge, because these systems face stringent error (type I and II) requirements and operate in difficult signal-jamming environments, with intensive signal-like jamming and a variety of changing possible signal portraits of possible recognized events. To address these issues, we have developed a twolevel event detection architecture, where the primary classifier is based on an ensemble of deep convolutional networks, can recognize 7 classes of signals and receives time-space data frames as input. Using real-life data, we have shown that the applied methods result in efficient and robust multiclass detection algorithms that have a high degree of adaptability.", "text": "abstract. paper show approach build deep learning algorithms recognizing signals distributed ﬁber optic monitoring security systems long perimeters. synthesizing detection algorithms poses non-trivial research development challenge systems face stringent error requirements operate diﬃcult signal-jamming environments intensive signal-like jamming variety changing possible signal portraits possible recognized events. address issues developed two-level event detection architecture primary classiﬁer based ensemble deep convolutional networks recognize classes signals receives time-space data frames input. using real-life data shown applied methods result eﬃcient robust multiclass detection algorithms high degree adaptability. today distributed ﬁber optic vibration sensors used many areas undergo rapid development improving sensitivity selectivity characteristics number design advantages ﬁber optic sensors common monitoring security long perimeters applications monitoring major pipelines. types ﬁber optic systems operates based time-domain detection backward rayleigh scattered light short laser pulse injected cable coherence reﬂectometer uses narrowband high-stable reference laser light source allows intensities backscattered signals phase delay factored meanwhile vibrations environment sensor operates cause micro-vibrations optic ﬁber sensor displacing rayleigh scattering centers relative other. result spatially localized disturbances sensor cause local modulation coherence reﬂectogram intensity. figure schematic structural functional diagram coherence optical time domain reﬂectometer reference laser;
