This framework supports acquisition (learning grounded meanings of nouns and prepositions from human annotation of robotic driving paths), generation (using such acquired meanings to generate sentential description of new robotic driving paths), and comprehension (using such acquired meanings to support automated driving to accomplish navigational goals specified in natural language). We evaluate the performance of these three tasks by having independent human judges rate the semantic fidelity of the sentences associated with paths, achieving overall average correctness of 94.6% and overall average completeness of 85.6%.", "text": "present uniﬁed framework natural-language supports semantics framework supports acquisition generation comprehension evaluate performance three

teller harris nothing turns however. principle could replace grammar mechanism generating logical form. paper concerns semantics syntax addresses issues relating grounding logical form. particular grammar simply convenient surface representation logical form. prepositions modiﬁers nouns noun phrases indicated subscript ‘sr’ adjuncts verbs verb phrases indicated subscript ‘path.’ many prepositions used path form. share semantic representation uses learned pooled data kinds occurrences training corpus. furthermore note grammar supports inﬁnite recursion noun phrases contain prepositional phrases that turn contain noun phrases. finally note grammar supports conjunctions prepositional phrases path form. employ logical form shown fig. informally formulas logical form denote paths ﬂoorplan. paths ﬂoorplans speciﬁed collections waypoints. waypoint cartesian coordinate optionally labeled class object resides coordinate e.g. waypoint unlabeled e.g. object resides coordinate. ﬂoorplan labeled waypoints path sequence unlabeled waypoints formula logical form contains three parts path quantiﬁer ﬂoorplan quantiﬁer condition path ﬂoorplan must satisfy. condition conjunction

parsing surface generation techniques bidirectionally between surface language form speciﬁed grammar fig. logical form fig. example surface form like note above nouns correspond one-argument

generation care three properties correctness sentence logically true path completeness sentence differentiate intended path possible paths conciseness sentence shortest attempt balance properties following heuristic algorithm first sample path waypoints sampled points evenly distribute along path. downsample path computing integral distance traveled initial position point dense path selecting subsequence whose points separated integral path length. produce path prepositional phrase describe path waypoint selecting atomic formula maximum posterior probability constructed two-argument predicate path waypoint ﬁrst argument ﬂoorplan waypoint second argument. identical choices consecutive sets waypoints path coalesced short intervals path prepositional phrases discarded. generate noun

orientation waypoints becomes increasingly sensitive small changes position become closer together. remedy problems path waypoints getting close objects other barrier penalty term added pair path waypoint ﬂoorplan waypoint well pairs temporally adjacent path waypoints prevent becoming close. term distance waypoints becomes less threshold point decreases rapidly. finally formulation semantics prepositions based angles distance. thus large subspace ﬂoor leads equal probability satisfying atomic formula i.e. cones fig. allows path satisfy prepositional phrase like left chair away chair. remedy this small attraction path waypoint ﬂoorplan waypoints selected reference objects prefer short distances. postprocessing step performs obstacle avoidance adding additional path waypoints
