We numerically investigated the classification performance of a conventional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a deep neural network, under the condition that reconstructed page data are contaminated by some noise and are randomly laterally shifted. The MLP was found to have a classification accuracy of 91.58%, whereas the deep neural network was able to classify data pages at an accuracy of 99.98%. The accuracy of the deep neural network is two orders of magnitude better than the MLP.", "text": "tomoyoshi shimobaba* naoki kuwata mizuha homma takayuki takahashi yuki nagahama marie sano satoki hasegawa ryuji hirayama takashi kakue atsushi shiraki naoki takada tomoyoshi graduate school engineering chiba university yayoi-cho inage-ku chiba japan department electrical electronics engineering chiba university yayoi-cho inage-ku chiba japan institute management information technologies chiba university yayoi-cho inage-ku chiba japan science department natural sciences cluster research education faculty kochi university kochi japan *corresponding author shimobabafaculty.chiba-u.jp propose deep-learning-based classiﬁcation data pages used holographic memory. numerically investigated classiﬁcation performance conventional multi-layer perceptron deep neural network condition reconstructed page data contaminated noise randomly laterally shifted. found classiﬁcation accuracy whereas deep neural network able classify data pages accuracy accuracy deep neural network orders magnitude better mlp. optical society america optical memories compact discs digital versatile discs blu-ray discs utilize laser spots read write digital data. recording disk irradiated laser spot condensed lens. increasing memory capacity requires miniaturization laser spot. blu-ray discs minimum spot approximately .µm. achieve higher density necessary laser shorter wavelength lens higher numerical aperture coming limit. holographic memory digital data converted two-dimensional pattern called data page recorded recording medium hologram. main features holographic memory below access speed fast data page read written twodimensional images multiple data pages stored recording area multiplex recording characteristics holography leading increase memory capacity. addition combination holographic memory optical encryption interesting increased security come expense increased encryption decryption time errors arising pixel misalignment noise. simple thresholding data page detected image sensor induces errors;
