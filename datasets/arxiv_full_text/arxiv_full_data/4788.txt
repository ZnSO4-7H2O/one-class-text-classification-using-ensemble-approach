{"title": "A Behavior Analysis-Based Game Bot Detection Approach Considering  Various Play Styles", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "An approach for game bot detection in MMORPGs is proposed based on the analysis of game playing behavior. Since MMORPGs are large scale games, users can play in various ways. This variety in playing behavior makes it hard to detect game bots based on play behaviors. In order to cope with this problem, the proposed approach observes game playing behaviors of users and groups them by their behavioral similarities. Then, it develops a local bot detection model for each player group. Since the locally optimized models can more accurately detect game bots within each player group, the combination of those models brings about overall improvement. For a practical purpose of reducing the workloads of the game servers in service, the game data is collected at a low resolution in time. Behavioral features are selected and developed to accurately detect game bots with the low resolution data, considering common aspects of MMORPG playing. Through the experiment with the real data from a game currently in service, it is shown that the proposed local model approach yields more accurate results.", "text": "approach game detection mmorpgs proposed based analysis game playing behavior. since mmorpgs large scale games users play various ways. variety playing behavior makes hard detect game bots based play behaviors. order cope problem proposed approach observes game playing behaviors users groups behavioral similarities. then develops local detection model player group. since locally optimized models accurately detect game bots within player group combination models brings overall improvement. practical purpose reducing workloads game servers service game data collected resolution time. behavioral features selected developed accurately detect game bots resolution data considering common aspects mmorpg playing. experiment real data game currently service shown proposed local model approach yields accurate results. game publishers strictly prohibit game bots yul-hyul-gang-ho online allows players purchase game item called black soul. since game bots also perform repetitive tasks given table selected features section developed features section subsets categorized battle collect move feature groups section respectively. lastly union whole aspect feature sets single aspect feature sets. hunjoo received computer science engineering chung-ang university seoul rep. korea respectively. joined etri daejeon rep. korea. postdoctoral researcher iowa state university iowa include game artificial", "year": 2015}
