{"title": "Predicting Auction Price of Vehicle License Plate with Deep Recurrent  Neural Network", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.EC", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In Chinese societies, superstition is of paramount importance, and vehicle license plates with desirable numbers can fetch very high prices in auctions. Unlike other valuable items, license plates are not allocated an estimated price before auction. I propose that the task of predicting plate prices can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) task, as the value depends on the meaning of each individual character on the plate and its semantics. I construct a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the prices of vehicle license plates in Hong Kong, based on the characters on a plate. I demonstrate the importance of having a deep network and of retraining. Evaluated on 13 years of historical auction prices, the deep RNN outperforms previous models by a significant margin.", "text": "chinese societies superstition paramount importance vehicle license

whereas west numbers desirable undesirable right various reasons chinese societies numbers derive superstitious value characters rhyme with. chinese language logosyllabic analytic combinations numbers stand sound-alike phrases. combinations numbers rhyme phrases positive connotations thus desirable. example rhythms prosperity chinese major chinese business portal looking historical data analyzed
