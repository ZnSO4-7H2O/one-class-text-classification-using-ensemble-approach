We describe an integrated architecture, based on our expe-rience at Blue Martini Software, for supporting this integration. The architecture can dramatically reduce the pre-processing, cleaning, and data understanding effort often documented to take 80% of the time in knowledge discovery projects. We emphasize the need for data collection at the application server layer (not the web server) in order to support logging of data and metadata that is essential to the discovery process. We describe the data transformation bridges required from the transaction processing systems and customer event streams (e.g., clickstreams) to the data warehouse. We detail the mining workbench, which needs to provide multiple views of the data through reporting, data mining algorithms, visualization, and OLAP. We con-clude with a set of challenges.", "text": "show e-commerce domain provide right ingredients successful data mining claim killer domain data mining. describe integrated architecture based

architecture advantages appear following sections. described system ideal architecture based experiences blue martini software. however make claim everything described implemented blue martini software’s products. proposed architecture three main components business data definition customer interaction analysis. connecting components three data transfer bridges stage data build data warehouse deploy results. relationship components data transfer bridges illustrated figure next describe component architecture bridges connect components. business data definition component ecommerce business user defines data metadata associated business. data includes merchandising information content information business rules data mining perspective business data definition component ability define rich attributes type data. example products attributes like size color targeted group arranged hierarchy representing categories like men’s women’s subcategories like shoes shirts. another example page templates attributes indicating whether show products search results used part checkout process. diverse available attributes essential data mining also personalizing customer experience. customer interaction component provides interface customers e-commerce business. although example site throughout paper term customer interaction applies generally sort interaction customers. interaction could take place site customer service wireless application even bricks-and-mortar point sale system. effective analysis data sources data collector needs integrated part customer interaction component. provide maximum utility data collector sale transactions also types customer interactions page views site. details data collection architecture specific case site described section illustrate utility integrated data collection consider example ecommerce company measuring effectiveness banner advertisements sites geared attracting customers site. similar analysis applied measuring effectiveness advertising different personalizations site. cost banner advertisement typically based number click-throughs. paid visitor clicks banner advertisement. many e-commerce companies measure effectiveness banner advertisements using metric number click-throughs thus fail take account sales generated referred visitor. goal sell products site needs attract buyers rather browsers. recent forrester research report stated using hits page views judge site success like evaluating musical performance volume. practice seen ratio generated sales click-throughs vary much factor across company’s banner advertisements. advertisement generated five times much sales anadvertisement even though clickthroughs former advertisement quarter clickstreams latter. ability measure sort relationship requires conflation multiple data sources. analysis component provides integrated environment decision support utilizing data transformations reporting data mining algorithms visualization olap tools. richness available metadata gives analysis component significant advantages horizontal decision support tools power ease-of-use. instance system automatically knows type attribute including whether discrete attribute’s values ordered whether range continuous attribute bounded textual descriptions. site system knows customer sessions session includes page views orders. makes simple matter compute aggregate statistics combinations customers sessions page views orders automatically. examine integrated analysis component detail section stage data bridge connects business data definition component customer interaction component. bridge transfers data metadata customer interaction component. staging process several advantages including ability test changes implemented production allowing changes data formats replication components efficiency enabling e-commerce businesses zero down-time. build data warehouse bridge links customer interaction component analysis component. bridge transfers data collected within customer interaction component analysis component builds data warehouse analysis purposes. build data warehouse bridge also transfers business data defined within business data definition component data collector customer interaction component usually implemented within on-line transaction processing system typically designed using entity relation modeling techniques. oltp systems geared towards efficient handling large number small updates short queries. critical running e-commerce business appropriate analysis usually requires full scans several large tables star schema design business users understand. data mining need build data warehouse using dimensional modeling techniques. data warehouse design data transfer oltp system data warehouse system complex time-consuming tasks. making construction data warehouse integral part architecture significantly reduces complexity tasks. addition typical functionality bridge supports import integration data external systems syndicated data providers since schema oltp system controlled architecture automatically convert oltp schema multi-dimensional star schema optimized analysis. last bridge deploy results closing loop making analytical results actionable. provides ability transfer models scores results attributes constructed using data transformations back business data definition customer interaction components business rules personalization. example customers scored propensity accept cross-sell site personalized based scores. arguably difficult part knowledge discovery process implement non-integrated system. however shared metadata across three components means results directly reflected data defines ecommerce company’s business. section describes data collection component proposed architecture. component logs customers’ transactions event streams data collection component part every customer touch point section describe detail data collection site. concepts techniques mentioned section could easily extended customer touch points. e-commerce architectures rely server logs packet sniffers source clickstream data. systems advantage non-intrusive allowing bolt ecommerce application fall short logging high level events lack capability exploit metadata available application. typical contains data page requested time request client http address etc. server request. page requested server huge number requests images content page. since recorded server logs data logs relates requests image files mostly useless analysis commonly filtered out. requests need purged logs used. stateless nature http request appears independent requests becomes extremely difficult identify users user sessions data since logs contain name page requested page names mapped content products etc. page. problem compounded introduction dynamic content page used display different content user. case details content displayed page even captured log. mechanism used send request data server also affects information logs. browser sends request using post method input parameters request recorded log. packet sniffers collect similar data looking data wire. packet sniffers data present logs still problems identifying users sessions. also given myriad ways sites designed extremely difficult extract logical business information looking data streaming across wire. complicate things packet sniffers can’t data areas site encoded secure transmission thus difficulty working sites areas site crucial analysis including checkout forms containing personal data. many financial sites including banks entire site secure thus making packet sniffers monitor encrypted data blind essentially useless sniffers must given access data prior encryption complicates integration. collecting data application server layer effectively solve problems. since application server serves content detailed knowledge content served. true even content dynamically generated encoded transmission using ssl. application servers cookies keep track user’s session sessionizing clickstream trivial. since application server also keeps track user using login mechanisms cookies associating clickstream particular visitor simple. application server also designed keep track information absent server logs including pages aborted local time user speed user’s connection user turned cookies off. method collecting clickstream data significant advantages logs packet sniffers. clickstream data collected application server rich interesting; however significant insight gained looking subsets requests logical event episode call aggregations requests business events. business events also used describe significant user actions like sending email searching since application server maintain context user’s session related data application server logical choice logging business events. business events used track things like contents abandoned shopping carts extremely difficult track using clickstream data. business events also enable marketers look beyond page rates micro-conversion rates microconversion rate defined step purchasing process fraction products successfully carried next step purchasing process. examples fraction product views resulted product added shopping cart fraction products shopping cart successfully passed phase checkout process. thus integrated approach proposed architecture gives marketers ability look directly product views content views product sales capability powerful page views click-throughs. interesting business events help analysis given supported architecture search keywords number results searches logged search events give marketers significant insight interests visitors effectiveness search mechanism. architecture also supports rules engine runs site personalization. rules deployed offering promotions visitors displaying specific products content specific visitor etc. rules deployed business events used track effect deploying rules. business event collected time rule used personalization events coupled shopping-cart/checkout events give excellent estimate effectiveness rule. architecture also control groups personalization rules activated fraction target visitors. enables analysts directly look sales results visitors rules activated. similar data collection techniques used customer touch points like customer service representatives wireless applications etc. collecting right data critical effective analysis ecommerce operation. section describes analysis component architecture. start discussion data transformations followed analysis techniques including reporting data mining algorithms visualizamodeling usually prerequisite analysis experience shows many analyses require additional data transformations convert data forms amenable data mining. mentioned earlier business user define product promotion assortment hierarchies business data definition component. figure gives simple example product hierarchy. hierarchical information valuable analysis existing data mining algorithms utilize directly. therefore need data transformations convert information format used data mining algorithms. possible solution column indicating whether item falls given node hierarchy. product hierarchy shown figure example. order line page request containing product transformation creates boolean column corresponding selected node hierarchy. indicates whether product belongs product category represented node. figure shows enriched operation. since customers main concern ecommerce business data mining analyses customer level. record data final stage analysis customer signature containing information customer. however majority data data warehouse levels order header level order line level page request level. customer multiple rows levels. make detailed information useful analyses customer level aggregation transformations necessary. examples attributes found useful attributes hard construct using standard statements need powerful aggregation transformations. found attributes particularly useful e-commerce domain. portant patterns. however common date time format containing year month hour minute second often supported data mining algorithms. patterns involving date time cannot directly discovered format. make discovery patterns involving dates times easier need transformations compute time difference dates create attributes representing day-ofweek day-of-month week month quarter year etc. date time attributes. based considerations mentioned above architecture designed support rich transformations. found transformations including create attributes hierarchy attributes aggregate filter sample delete columns score useful making analyses easier. transformations described discuss analysis tools. basic reporting bare necessity ecommerce. generated reports business users understand site working different levels different points view. example questions answered using reporting selling products? worst selling products? viewed pages? failed searches? conversion rates brand? distribution browsers? referrers visit count? referrers sales amount? abandoned products? model generation using data mining algorithms component architecture. reveals patterns customers purchases page views etc. generating models answer questions like based experience addition automatic data mining algorithms necessary provide interactive model modification tools support business insight. models either automatically generated created interactive modifications examined evaluated test data. purpose business users understand models deploying them. example found rule models measures confidence lift support individual rule level individual conjunct level useful addition overall accuracy model. experience following functionality useful interactively modifying rule model able view segment defined subset rules subset conjuncts rule. likely wonder split occurs instead split average session duration occurs minutes instead minutes. account creation date appear rule all? business user want change rule given humans good identifying patterns visualized data visualization olap tools greatly help business users gain insight business problems complementing reporting tools data mining algorithms. experience suggests visualization tools helpful understanding generated models site operations data itself. figure shows example visualization tool clearly reveals females aged years heavy spenders closely followed males aged years. section describe several challenging problems based experiences mining ecommerce data. complexity granularity problems differ represents real-life area believe improvements made. except first challenges problems deal data mining algorithmic challenges. business users merchandisers make decisions assortments products creative designers design sites marketers decide spend advertising dollars need understand results data mining. summary reports easiest understand usually easy provide especially specific vertical domains. simple visualizations charts two-dimensional scatterplots also easy understand provide information highlight patterns especially used conjunction color. data mining models however easy understand. classification rules easiest followed classification trees. visualization naïve-bayes classifier also easy business users understand second author's past experience. challenge define model types ways presenting business users. regression models come present them? present nearest-neighbor models example? present results association rule algorithms without overwhelming users tens thousands rules starting page technical understanding tools. experience even commercial report designers olap tools hard business users. common solutions provide templates common questions something works well well-defined vertical markets provide expertise consulting services organization. challenge find ways empower business users able serve themselves. mining page view level joining session customer attributes violates basic assumption inherent data mining algorithms namely records independently identically distributed. trying build model predict visits page happens visit often might rule visitor’s first name likely visit page rule multiple records support clearly generalize beyond specific joe. problem shared mining problems telecommunication domain challenge design algorithms support multiple granularity levels correctly. products commonly organized hierarchies skus derived products derived product families derived categories etc. product hierarchy usually three eight levels deep. customer purchases level items generalizations likely found higher levels algorithms designed support tree-structured attributes scale large product hierarchies. challenge support hierarchies within data mining algorithms. visitors’ demographics change people married children grow salaries change etc. changes needs modeled change. product attributes change choices available packaging material design change even quality improve degrade. attributes change time often referred \"slowly changing dimensions\" challenge keep track changes provide support changes analyses. bots crawlers dramatically change clickstream patterns site. example keynote provides site performance measurements. keynote generate request multiple times minute hours days week skewing statistics number sessions page hits exit pages search engines conduct breadth first scans site generating many requests short duration. internet explorer supports automatic synchronization pages user logs computer idle specified schedule; also supports offline browsing loads pages specified depth given page. options create additional clickstreams patterns. identifying bots filter clickstreams non-trivial task especially bots pretend real users. proposed architecture successfully integrates data mining e-commerce system. proposed architecture consists three main components business data definition customer interaction analysis connected using data transfer bridges. integration effectively solves several major problems associated horizontal data mining tools including enormous effort required preprocessing data used mining making results mining actionable. tight integration three components architecture allows automated construction data warehouse within analysis component. shared metadata across three components simplifies construction coupled rich mining algorithms analysis tools also increases efficiency knowledge discovery process. tight integration shared metadata also make easy deploy results effectively closing loop. finally presented several challenging problems need addressed enhancement architecture. would like thank members data mining visualization teams blue martini software documentation writer cindy hall. wish thank clients sharing data
