{"title": "Conversational Markers of Constructive Discussions", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Group discussions are essential for organizing every aspect of modern life, from faculty meetings to senate debates, from grant review panels to papal conclaves. While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g. voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However, this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive.  We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to determine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We exploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance between the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this framework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world exploration game developed and deployed to support this research. Using this setting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted from the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it will be a wasteful or a productive one.", "text": "group discussions essential organizing every aspect modern life faculty meetings senate debates grant review panels papal conclaves. costly terms time organization effort group discussions commonly seen reaching better decisions compared solutions require coordination individuals —through discussion becomes greater parts. however assumption irrefutable anecdotal evidence wasteful discussions abounds experiments discussions unproductive. propose framework analyzing conversational dynamics order determine whether given task-oriented discussion worth not. exploit conversational patterns reﬂecting ideas balance participants well linguistic choices. apply framework conversations naturally occurring online collaborative world exploration game developed deployed support research. using setting show linguistic cues conversational patterns extracted ﬁrst seconds team discussion predictive whether wasteful productive one. working teams common strategy decision making problem solving building effective social interaction abilities member enable team outperform lone individuals. evidence shows teams often perform better individuals even high chances reaching correct answers team members previously wrong furthermore team performance factor individual intelligence collective intelligence interpersonal interactions emotional intelligence playing important role people attest experience team interaction always smooth poor coordination lead unproductive meetings wasted time. fact romano nunamaker report third work-related meetings considered unproductive microsoft employee survey reports meetings ineffective. such many grow cynical meetings. computational methods ability reliably recognize unproductive discussions could important impact society. ideally system could provide actionable information discussion progresses indicating whether likely turn productive rather waste time. paper focus conversational aspects productive interactions take following steps introduce constructiveness framework allows characterize teams discussion enables better performance individuals could reach conversely teams better discussed reveal differences collective decision process characteristic productive unproductive teams show differences reﬂected conversational patterns. example language used ideas introduced adopted encodes important discriminative cues. measures interactional balance language matching also prove informative suggesting balanced discussions productive. results underline potential held computational approaches conversational dynamics. encourage work direction render dataset task-oriented discussions featureextraction code publicly available. existing computational work task-oriented group interaction largely focused well team performs. coetzee deployed studied impact chat-based team interaction platform massive open online courses ﬁnding teams reach correct answers individuals experience enjoyable. often studied experimental setting hcrc task corpus consisting conversations pairs people designated gives directions other. simpliﬁed setting avoids issues like role establishment leadership. reitter moore successful dialogs characterized longterm adaptation alignment linguistic structures syntactic lexical character level. notable feature work success prediction task attempted using ﬁrst minutes conversation. attempts authority level features inspired negotiation theory experimental meta-features task-speciﬁc features sociolinguistic spelling differences another research path uses negotiation tasks inspire dataset collection online bilateral negotiations roles ﬁxed success deﬁned sale going through. sokolova bag-of-words model investigate importance temporal aspects. sokolova lapalme measure informativeness quantiﬁed lexical sets degrees scalars comparatives. research success groups members less common. friedberg model grades group assignments class using measures average entrainment ﬁnding task-speciﬁc words strong cue. jung shows affective balance expressed teams correlates performance engineering tasks teams students. related study balance ﬁrst minutes interaction found predictive performance none research aware controls initial skill potential team members. management science network analysis reveals certain subgraphs found long-term structured teams indicate better performance rated senior managers controlled experiments show optimal structures depend complexity task studies well much research effective team crowdsourcing focus linguistic conversational factors. ﬁrst hurdle reliably quantify productive group conversations are. problem-solving ultimate goal correct answer failing that come close possible. quantify closeness correct answer score often used better guesses higher scores;
