{"title": "Report: Dynamic Eye Movement Matching and Visualization Tool in Neuro  Gesture", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "In the research of the impact of gestures using by a lecturer, one challenging task is to infer the attention of a group of audiences. Two important measurements that can help infer the level of attention are eye movement data and Electroencephalography (EEG) data. Under the fundamental assumption that a group of people would look at the same place if they all pay attention at the same time, we apply a method, \"Time Warp Edit Distance\", to calculate the similarity of their eye movement trajectories. Moreover, we also cluster eye movement pattern of audiences based on these pair-wised similarity metrics. Besides, since we don't have a direct metric for the \"attention\" ground truth, a visual assessment would be beneficial to evaluate the gesture-attention relationship. Thus we also implement a visualization tool.", "text": "abstract. research impact gestures using lecturer challenging task infer attention group audiences. important measurements help infer level

gesture-attention relationship. thus also implement visualization tool. well studied people’s gazing position would reveal visual stimuli people receive. saliency item deﬁned state quality stands relative neighbors considered attention mechanism facilitates many learning tasks several recent neural science studies discovered speciﬁc tissues neurons would support mechanism. example snow studied pulvinar nuclei modulates physical/perceptual salience attentional selection. besides baliki discovered d-type medium spiny neurons d-type medium spiny neurons within nacc shell assigns aversive motivational salience aversive stimuli. several previous studies concentrated relation viewer’s attention visual stimuli loschky dewhurst valuch al.. used tracking data order discover similar

visualization tool’s design illustrate display summarize work future challenges section form eye-tracking data essentially multi-dimensional time-series data multiple objects. thus discuss several time-series matching methods strength weakness applied task. inter-subject correlation movement emerging topic would lead toward better understanding correlated activity individuals stimuli. previous studies burleson-lesser employed tools statistical mechanics powerful explain emergent properties local interactions subjects. demonstrated audiences’ movement would distributed balance randomness

tkaˇcik computed correlation among movement using direction every pair viewers however considering setting experiment homophily movement could explained video content attention individual certain moment. interaction audiences doesn’t physical meaning serves analogy. importantly purpose inferring attention audience visual stimuli choose rely ﬁxation instead movement direction. since discovered many cases would cause viewer diﬀerent movement direction actually getting attracted subject. example camera shifting scene switching people’s gazing position would random ﬁrst then concentrated object camera switching movement direction period would diverse hinders fact viewers actually similar attention. besides method used would provide little tolerance mismatch temporal dimension. observation individual viewers always diﬀerent response time visual stimuli. many medical studies jain discovered variation individuals. thus explore methods time series matching using ﬁxation data serve research. time series similarity measures central task domain analysis prediction classiﬁcation information unfolding time. given time series similarity function calculate point corresponding point timestamp belongs family lock-step measure. lock-step measures including euclidean distance matching introduced faloutsos along variants using lpnorms introduced al.. advantage methods simplicity. matching shown figure however case eye-tracking data time inaccuracy ﬁxation measurement diﬀerent response time among individuals methods would give large distance audience faster response audience relatively slower even trajectories following pattern. another rather novel family approaches threshold-based measure. example tquest distance introduced aßfalg using threshold parameter transform time series threshold-crossing time intervals. time interval treated point dimensional space. minkowski sequences served similarity. matching shown figure general approach would suitable data similar amplitude value diﬀerent temporal value. however eye-tracking data collect shows diverse pattern temporal value amplitude value. families approaches also well studied. feature-based measures fourier coeﬃcients matching introduced oppenheim used discrete fourier transforms time series ﬁlter highfrequency coeﬃcients making eﬃcient methods remove rapidly ﬂuctuating signal components. case also suﬀered able adapt diﬀerences among individual responses. family pattern-based measure including spade introduced chen matches segments within entire time series adjusting value temporal amplitude dimensions. although method concentrates matching patterns time series case shifting amplitude value would problematic. audiences would generally attention object thus similar ﬁxation attracted lecture. eﬀective family matching methods data might elastic measure. methods family generally would allowed matching oneto-many one-to-none points. case ﬁxation data points missing people’s attention would stay relatively longer object move slower others. popular method family would dynamic time warping introduced berndt method aligns time series temporal domain minimize cost

allows possibility matching points. clustering based pair-wise relationship data points well studied problem various solutions. however since number group granularity cluster unknown adopting traditional clustering method would force determine number. however seek optimal number clusters might unwanted operation since want make clustering criteria consistent whole lecture. part lecture might simply attractive people would attention similar object parts delivering interesting information thus people starting looking around. certain scenario cluster number vary accordingly. thus adopt community detection solve problem. community detection compared traditional clustering method number cluster always unknown. methods rank communities using criterion. also studied simon dataset often several levels granularity resulting various clustering several resolutions. small clusters could generated scale analysis large scale analysis could result larger clusters. many studies including martelot huang proposed criteria designated suﬃce multi-scale analysis. however limited eﬃciency accuracy. stead method proposed martelot could enable fast multi-scale community detection large
