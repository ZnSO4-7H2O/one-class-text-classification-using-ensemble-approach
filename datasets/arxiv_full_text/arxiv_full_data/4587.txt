{"title": "On Move Pattern Trends in a Large Go Games Corpus", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We process a large corpus of game records of the board game of Go and propose a way of extracting summary information on played moves. We then apply several basic data-mining methods on the summary information to identify the most differentiating features within the summary information, and discuss their correspondence with traditional Go knowledge. We show statistically significant mappings of the features to player attributes such as playing strength or informally perceived \"playing style\" (e.g. territoriality or aggressivity), describe accurate classifiers for these attributes, and propose applications including seeding real-work ranks of internet players, aiding in Go study and tuning of Go-playing programs, or contribution to Go-theoretical discussion on the scope of \"playing style\".", "text": "abstract—we process large corpus game records board game propose extracting summary information played moves. apply several basic datamining methods summary information identify differentiating features within summary information discuss correspondence traditional knowledge. show statistically signiﬁcant mappings features player attributes playing strength informally perceived playing style describe accurate classiﬁers attributes propose applications including seeding real-work ranks internet players aiding study tuning go-playing programs contribution go-theoretical discussion scope playing style. creating program play game ﬁnding best move given board position make method developed course research apply analysis existing game records helping humans play understand game better instead. two-player full-information board game played square grid black white stones;

reﬂects weak ordering bottom half dimension global ordering within dimension. consider games seigen playing across several distinct eras also famous radical opening experiments throughout time thus featuring especially high diversity patterns. consider games ishida yoshio yamashita keigo analysis since signiﬁcant outliers making high-order dimensions much like purely similarity player. takemiya masaki similar effect ﬁrst dimension case corresponds common knowledge extreme proponent anti-territorial style. consider games year since ch’ang-ho prominent representative balanced careful player still reputation minds many players regarded altered style signiﬁcantly afterwards. cannot terms classic modern case since current patterns commonplace games past centuries many would call old-time patterns modern inventions. perhaps infer latest th-century play trends abandon many th-century experiments return ordinary effective classic patterns. present patterns simpliﬁed compact form; reality usually somewhat larger always circle-shaped omit pattern segments entirely empty. give textual interpretation patterns especially since obvious unless seen game context; choose descriptions based frequently observer contexts course pattern also matched positions situations. dimensions middle-game patterns occur less frequently require extended normalization over-shadowed opening patterns. e.g. characteristic patterns aggressiveness dimension represent moves make life small unstable groups novel-ranked players seem like famous tsukein middle game basic areas inﬂuence staked invasions group attacks played out. notably board much ﬁlled opening thus particular speciﬁc-shape patterns repeat less often. joseki sequence. either mean novel nobi players like play joseki more novel players likely unorthodox situation require resorting tsuke-nobi sequence. believe next step interpreting analytical results reﬁned prior information input precise analysis outputs experts. fig. shows sociomap visualisation alternate view player relationships similarity well correlation expert-given style marks decomposition. four-dimensional style vectors used observe terrain sociomap reasonably smooth demonstrating level connection style vectors data-mined information. high countour density indicates discrepancy;

ideally would fully cover style marks domain however training sample turns small that. believe ﬁndings might useful many applications area support software well goplaying computer engines. however foremost style analysis excellent teaching classifying style dimensions based player’s pattern vector many study recommendations given e.g. professional games replay goal balancing understanding various styles achieve well-rounded skill set. userfriendly tool based work currently development. another promising application envision helping determine initial real-world rating player ﬁrst tournament based sample games played internet; players especially less populated areas could fairly strong playing ﬁrst real tournament. similarly computer program quickly classify level human opponent based pattern vector previous games auto-adjust difﬁculty settings accordingly provide even games beginners. also achieved using win-loss statistics pattern vector analysis converge faster initially providing much better user experience. hope strong players look style dimensions found statistical analysis analysis played patterns prospective opponents might prepare tournament game especially hope insights strategic purposes various shapes general human understanding game might improved investigating style-speciﬁc patterns. course challenging predict possible uses work others. less obvious applications might include analysis pattern vectors extracted games go-playing programs strength style classiﬁcation might help highlight weaknesses room improvements. also historical game records still occassionally discovered; pattern-based classiﬁcation might help suggest verify origin games archeology. since aware previous research topic limited space time constraints plenty research remains done parts analysis already noted many text above. signiﬁcantly different methods generating normalizing vectors explored data mining methods could investigated. better ways visualising relationships would desirable together thorough expert dissemination internal structure player pattern vectors space professional players consulted ﬁndings style scales calibration. strength analysis could also used similar fashion lesson learned cannot simply play pattern often; instead insight lays underlying reason disproportionate frequency patterns. course correlation imply causation certainly suggest simply optimizing go-playing programs according vectors. however could hint general shortcomings playing engines actual cause e.g. surprisingly strength prediction investigated. argued many players adjust style game conditions styles might express differently various game stages. factors explored building pattern vectors carefully simply considering moves games player. impact handicap uneven games by-strength distribution also investigated. proposed extract summary pattern information game collections combined various data mining methods show correspondence pattern summaries various player meta-information playing strength play playing style ranked expert players. implemented measured proposals case studies per-rank characteristics amateur players per-player style/era characteristics well-known professionals. many details remain worked demonstrated many signiﬁcant correlations doubtlessly exist practically viable infer player metainformation extracted pattern summaries proposed applications inference. finally outlined many possible directions future work newly staked research ﬁeld boundary computer data mining theory. foremostly grateful detailed input speciﬁc styles alexander dinerstein motoki noguchi v´ıt brunner. appreciate helpful comments general methodology john fairbairn hall cyril h¨oschl robert jasiek frantiˇsek mr´az several godiscussions.com users finally would like thank radka chidori haneˇckov´a original research idea acknowledge major inspiration r´emi coulom’s paper extraction pattern information. ghoneim essam abbass competency awareness strategic decision making cognitive methods situation awareness decision support ieee first international multidisciplinary conference feb. coulom computing ratings move patterns game computer games workshop herik mark winands uiterwijk maarten schadd eds. amsterdam paysbas available http//hal.inria.fr/inria-/en/ s´ykora bahbouh h¨oschl using visualisation group structure dynamics team development thconference theinternational military training association", "year": 2012}
