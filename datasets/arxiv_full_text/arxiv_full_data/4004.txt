{"title": "Identification of arabic word from bilingual text using character  features", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "The identification of the language of the script is an important stage in the process of recognition of the writing. There are several works in this research area, which treat various languages. Most of the used methods are global or statistical. In this present paper, we study the possibility of using the features of scripts to identify the language. The identification of the language of the script by characteristics returns the identification in the case of multilingual documents less difficult. We present by this work, a study on the possibility of using the structural features to identify the Arabic language from an Arabic / Latin text.", "text": "abstract— identification language script
