{"title": "Separation of Water and Fat Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signals Using  Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Purpose: A new method for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging water-fat separation using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) and deep learning (DL) is presented. Feasibility of the method with complex and magnitude images is demonstrated with a series of patient studies and accuracy of predicted quantitative values is analyzed.  Methods: Water-fat separation of 1200 gradient-echo acquisitions from 90 imaging sessions (normal, acute and chronic myocardial infarction) was performed using a conventional model based method with modeling of R2* and off-resonance and a multi-peak fat spectrum. A U-Net convolutional neural network for calculation of water-only, fat-only, R2* and off-resonance images was trained with 900 gradient-echo Multiple and single-echo complex and magnitude input data algorithms were studied and compared to conventional extended echo modeling.  Results: The U-Net ConvNet was easily trained and provided water-fat separation results visually comparable to conventional methods. Myocardial fat deposition in chronic myocardial infarction and intramyocardial hemorrhage in acute myocardial infarction were well visualized in the DL results. Predicted values for R2*, off-resonance, water and fat signal intensities were well correlated with conventional model based water fat separation (R2>=0.97, p<0.001). DL images had a 14% higher signal-to-noise ratio (p<0.001) when compared to the conventional method.  Conclusion: Deep learning utilizing ConvNets is a feasible method for MR water-fat separationimaging with complex, magnitude and single echo image data. A trained U-Net can be efficiently used for MR water-fat separation, providing results comparable to conventional model based methods.", "text": "bley wieben francois brittain reeder water magnetic resonance imaging. magn reson imaging dixon techniques water imaging. magn reson imaging eggers bornert chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation methods. magn reson imaging dixon simple proton spectroscopic imaging. radiology hamilton yokoo bydder cruite schroeder sirlin middleton vivo characterization liver spectrum. biomed shimakawa mckenzie brodsky brittain reeder multiecho waterfat separation simultaneous estimation multifrequency spectrum modeling. magn reson hines agni roen rowland hernando bultman horng shimakawa brittain reeder validation biomarkers hepatic steatosis presence iron overload ob/ob mouse. magn reson imaging nguyen marquez heunis wyatt kazakia burghardt karampinos carballido-gamio krug validation bone marrow quantification presence trabecular bone using mri. magn reson imaging hines smith reeder variations content murine brown white adipose tissues chemical-shift mri. magn reson imaging hernando vigen shimakawa reeder mapping presence macroscopic field variations. magn reson glover schneider three-point dixon technique true water/fat decomposition inhomogeneity correction. magn reson hernando liang kellman chemical shift-based water/fat separation comparison signal models. magn reson hernando sharma kramer reeder confounding effect temperature chemical shift-encoded quantification. magn reson bydder yokoo hamilton middleton chavez schwimmer lavine sirlin relaxation effects quantification using gradient echo imaging. magn reson imaging peterson svensson mansson relaxation effects mri-based quantification content fatty acid composition. magn reson hines shimakawa mckenzie brittain reeder independent corrected accurate spectral modeling quantification validation fat-water-spio phantom. magn reson imaging meisamy hines hamilton sirlin mckenzie brittain reeder quantification hepatic steatosis t-independent t-corrected imaging spectral modeling blinded comparison spectroscopy. radiology shimakawa alley reeder hargreaves water-fat separation bipolar multiecho sequences. magn reson shin roth nogues mollura summers deep convolutional neural networks computer-aided detection architectures dataset characteristics transfer learning. ieee transactions medical imaging schmidhuber deep learning neural networks overview. neural networks hernando kellman haldar liang robust water/fat separation presence large field inhomogeneities using graph algorithm. magn reson breath-hold water imaging using dual-echo two-point dixon technique efficient robust phase-correction algorithm. magn reson goldfarb hasan imaging reperfused intramyocardial hemorrhage cardiovascular magnetic resonance susceptibility weighted imaging plos goldfarb hasan zhao magnetic resonance susceptibility weighted phase imaging assessment reperfusion intramyocardial hemorrhage. magn reson goldfarb roth myocardial deposition left ventricular myocardial infarction assessment using water-fat separation imaging. radiology goldfarb fat-water separated delayed hyperenhanced myocardial infarct imaging. magn reson imagery. magn reson bornert hernando kellman reeder sirlin ismrm workshop fat-water separation insights applications progress mri. magn reson ronneberger fischer brox u-net convolutional networks biomedical image segmentation. springer. chollet others keras. github;
