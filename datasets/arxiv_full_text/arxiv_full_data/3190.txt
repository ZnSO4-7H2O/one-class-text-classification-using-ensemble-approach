{"title": "Painting Analysis Using Wavelets and Probabilistic Topic Models", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In this paper, computer-based techniques for stylistic analysis of paintings are applied to the five panels of the 14th century Peruzzi Altarpiece by Giotto di Bondone. Features are extracted by combining a dual-tree complex wavelet transform with a hidden Markov tree (HMT) model. Hierarchical clustering is used to identify stylistic keywords in image patches, and keyword frequencies are calculated for sub-images that each contains many patches. A generative hierarchical Bayesian model learns stylistic patterns of keywords; these patterns are then used to characterize the styles of the sub-images; this in turn, permits to discriminate between paintings. Results suggest that such unsupervised probabilistic topic models can be useful to distill characteristic elements of style.", "text": "paper computer-based techniques stylistic analysis paintings applied panels century peruzzi altarpiece giotto bondone. features extracted combining dual-tree complex wavelet transform hidden markov tree model. hierarchical clustering used identify stylistic keywords image patches keyword frequencies calculated sub-images contains many patches. generative hierarchical bayesian model learns stylistic patterns keywords;
