Most of the time the combination rules are evaluated only on simple examples. We study here different combination rules and compare them in terms of decision on real data. Indeed, in real applications, we need a reliable decision and it is the final results that matter. Two applications are presented here: a fusion of human experts opinions on the kind of underwater sediments depict on sonar image and a classifier fusion for radar targets recognition.", "text":

purposes e.g. help navigation autonomous underwater vehicles provide data sedimentologists. sonar applications seabed images obtained many imperfections indeed order build images huge number physical

diﬀerent approaches information fusion order outperform three radar target classiﬁers present results reached fusion three classiﬁers conjunctive rule dsmh pcr. three classiﬁers used ﬁrst fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer second multilayer perceptron feed forward fully connected neural network. third sart classiﬁer uses principle prototype generation like neural network unlike prototypes generated supervised manner. target illuminated acquisition phase frequency stepped signal. data snapshot contains frequency steps uniformly distributed band results frequency increment mhz. consequently slant range resolution ambiguity window given complex signature obtained backscattered snapshot coherently integrated order achieve slant range proﬁle corresponding given aspect given target. targets range proﬁles numerical outputs classiﬁers target classiﬁer normalized deﬁne masses. order keep credible classes consider highest values outputs referred classiﬁer target hence obtain three focal elements classiﬁer provide equivalent belief mean. example fuzzy k-nearest neighbors classiﬁer provide easily belief target whereas classiﬁers provide always belief null second target
