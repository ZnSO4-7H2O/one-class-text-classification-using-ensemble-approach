{"title": "A Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process Model for Musical Pitch", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Partially observable Markov decision processes have been widely used to provide models for real-world decision making problems. In this paper, we will provide a method in which a slightly different version of them called Mixed observability Markov decision process, MOMDP, is going to join with our problem. Basically, we aim at offering a behavioural model for interaction of intelligent agents with musical pitch environment and we will show that how MOMDP can shed some light on building up a decision making model for musical pitch conveniently.", "text": "first mention theoretical background work. section propose model musical pitch based momdps. section addresses implementation issues presents experiment evaluate model. finally make concluding remarks discuss prospective potential developments models applications. beside standard models pomdp model called momdp makes slightly diﬀerent former one. latter basically factored pomdp beneﬁts factorizing states. momdp model state factored different variables writing mean consisted variables stands fully observable state stands partially observable state. thus factorized would partially observable markov decision processes widely used provide models real-world decision making problems. paper provide method slightly diﬀerent version called mixed observability markov decision process momdp going join problem. basically oﬀering behavioural model interaction intelligent agents musical pitch environment show momdp shed light building decision making model musical pitch conveniently. partially observable markov decision processes widely used provide models real-world decision making problems. provide mathematical framework model interaction agent environment. notable characteristics pomdps ability keep planning dynamic environments uncertainty knowledge authors previously mentioned mdps pomdps ﬁeld computer music. among them could mention demonstrated pomdps control musical behaviour diﬀerent conditions. paper propose novel model interaction agents musical pitch environment based variant pomdps called mixed observability markov decision process music theory know compound interval decomposed octaves simple interval idea also brought simple intervals. momdp-based model agent makes decisions according states receives environment musical pitch space. momdp denoted tuple relationship between quantities musical concepts model given elaborately following. model fully observable state represents musical pitch agent precise estimate frequency time plus interval agent supposed make. sake simplicity consider natural musical pitches main intervals beyond octave interintermediate state regarding actions agent makes. technically space partially observable states space fully observable states. parameter observations agent makes possible values parameter values finally parameter discount factor reward ﬁrst interval decomposition reward given second one. testing model developed q-learning algorithm perform similar task done made interactions system feeding relative pitch pattern depicted figure system. learning experiment learning parameters number interactions. better demonstration musical learning results presented intervals notes. thus y-axis figure indicates intervals x-axis notes interval-note pair. gray-scale values show learned q-value intensity shows policy learned results experiments imply agent efﬁciently learned behaviour policy. addition figure agent learned given pitch contour also state-action pairs. mainly happened method beneﬁts factorizing state couple fully-observable partially-observable states. approach obviously help faster convergence agent interacting musical pitch environment.", "year": 2012}
