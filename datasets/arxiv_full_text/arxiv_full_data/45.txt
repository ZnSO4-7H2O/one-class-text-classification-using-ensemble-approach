{"title": "MIT at SemEval-2017 Task 10: Relation Extraction with Convolutional  Neural Networks", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Over 50 million scholarly articles have been published: they constitute a unique repository of knowledge. In particular, one may infer from them relations between scientific concepts, such as synonyms and hyponyms. Artificial neural networks have been recently explored for relation extraction. In this work, we continue this line of work and present a system based on a convolutional neural network to extract relations. Our model ranked first in the SemEval-2017 task 10 (ScienceIE) for relation extraction in scientific articles (subtask C).", "text": "work concentrate second step binary relations i.e. relations

sentence animal. ﬁrst argument animal second corresponding relation hyponym-of; however reverse argument order hyponym-of relation hold more. therefore crucial ensure provided information argument order able utilize given information efﬁciently. work former point addressed providing relative position features compared ﬁrst second argument relation respectively. order certify latter point experimented four strategies argument ordering outlined table table shows results experimenting various argument ordering strategies. correct order strategy performed worst negative sampling improved slightly ﬁxed order order strategies performed best. latter strategies performed almost equally well terms micro-averaged f-score. implies relation extraction advantageous original relation classes well reverse relation classes training instead using original relation classes correct argument ordering moreover ordering argument order appearance text training relation efﬁcient training relation examples possible argument ordering original relation class reverse relation class despite small size dataset. difference performance correct order versus ﬁxed order strategies prominent hyponym-of relation synonym-of relation. expected since argument ordering strategy different order-sensitive hyponymof relation. somewhat surprising though correct order strategy performs worse strategies even order-insensitive synonym-of relation. fact model training examples reversed argument ordering synonym-of relation. comparison negative sampling strategy learns original reversed argument ordering synonym-of relation performance comparable best performing strategies. also experimented different evaluation strategies models trained order ﬁxed order strategies. model trained order strategy choice evaluation strategy impact performance. contrast model trained ﬁxed order strategy performs better strategy used evaluation. reason model trained correct order strategy perform well since evaluated different strategy training namely order strategy know correct ordering arguments examples test set. also tried training binary classiﬁers hyponym-of synonym-of relations separately merging outputs best classiﬁers relations. binary classiﬁers individually performed better multi-way classiﬁer corresponding relation class overall performance based micro-averaged f-score improve multi-way classiﬁer merging outputs hyponym synonym classiﬁers. based results argument ordering strategy experiments submitted model trained using ﬁxed order strategy ranked number challenge. result shown table quantify
