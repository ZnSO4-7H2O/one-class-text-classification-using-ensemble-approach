Renewable energy sources like solar are not very lucrative in the current stage due to various uncertainties like weather, storage, land use among others. There also exists various other issues like mis-commitment of power, absence of intelligent fault analysis, congestion, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based system for predicting faults and selecting power generators optimally so as to reduce costs and ensure higher reliability in solar power systems. The results are highly encouraging and they suggest that the approaches proposed in this paper have the potential to be applied successfully in the developing world.", "text": "non-availability

thus choose optimal subset aims choose subset shows lesser variance prediction depending current weather conditions. thus loss used train network given certain cases even mis-prediction penalty choosing subset lower choosing another subset choosing subset might cause congestion network extremely possible subsets generators values computed scaled. input model voltages subset chosen vector
