{"title": "Learning Belief Networks in Domains with Recursively Embedded Pseudo  Independent Submodels", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "A pseudo independent (PI) model is a probabilistic domain model (PDM) where proper subsets of a set of collectively dependent variables display marginal independence. PI models cannot be learned correctly by many algorithms that rely on a single link search. Earlier work on learning PI models has suggested a straightforward multi-link search algorithm. However, when a domain contains recursively embedded PI submodels, it may escape the detection of such an algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm that ensures the learning of all embedded PI submodels whose sizes are upper bounded by a predetermined parameter. We show that this improved learning capability only increases the complexity slightly beyond that of the previous algorithm. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through experiment.", "text": "pseudo independent bilistic subsets variables models cannot learned algorithms earlier gested gorithm. recursively escape detection paper propose gorithm bedded submodels bounded show improved increases previous algorithm. mance algorithm several link lookahead search single head search link lookahead etc. turns models escape multi-link search xiang suggested head search first followed link lookahead followed link lookahead search effective different learning many alternative acquisition model probabilistic proper subsets ables display independent) learning networks head search identify ables. algorithms cannot learn correctly domain model unknown model incorrectly although search learn correctly found learning search model table single search link link search first discover submodel links submodel submodel double link lookahead links nected. consequently ani-map. realizing link search proposed three strategies following performed link lookahead combination head etc. shall refer systematic search lookaheads i-link examines links learned algorithm proposed search different pseudo independence property address quires models escape straightforward ing. suppose submodel multi-link tioned marginally main reason lookahead multiple models. completely model learned test number unlearned negative current answer. learned learned learn backtracking forward links necessary. link lookahead search perform proper arrangement double link lookahead followed triple lookahead performs links learned backtracks afterwards backtracks nation double-link-only continue shall refer search. double-link-only search combined-double-link search. stage search next iteration triple-link-only links added becomes succeed tion previous lookahead execution afterwards terminated. loop third stage search. figure shows execution model table value starts links examined learned. learned double足 second stage link-only sets links links submodels contained shown figure corresponding since links added double足 link-only link search links added figure tained. search halts complete order derive passes graph node graph corresponds pass search arrow indi足 cates chronological passes. shall label node number links locka足 head pass. example link search labeled link-only search constructed later conversion drawn level levels decreasing graph execution four nodes bottom left correspond passes three nodes child nodes correspond passes adds links. child nodes correspond links. number earning learning table hence node level h'ld given algorithm implementation plementation rithm instead pendence directly kullback-leib justified cross entropy obtained entropy empty structure minimization alleled greedy search weak dependence implied single contained requirement function bool lookahead; input number lookahead links. comment &his threshold. begin modified= false; repeat initialize links chordal implied done= false modified else done true; done true; return modified; models escape learning search difficult exist practice dition xiang proposed link search show contains submodels multi-link search proved algorithm domain recursively shown algorithm submodels within algorithm", "year": 2013}
