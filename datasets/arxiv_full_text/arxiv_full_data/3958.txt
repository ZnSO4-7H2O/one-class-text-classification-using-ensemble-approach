In the manner, using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as a pre-processing the data are scaled and then the dominant rules by RST, are elicited. Based on these rules variations of permeability in the different levels of Shivashan dam, Iran has been highlighted. Then, via using a combining of SOM and an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS) another analysis on the data was carried out. Finally, a brief comparison between the obtained results of RST and SOM-NFIS (briefly SONFIS) has been rendered.", "text": "study according modelling instruments using self organizing nfis analysis permeability data rounded shivashan site located north western iran. approach nfis utilized construct igs. self organizing feature kohonen self-organizing networks competition-based network paradigm data clustering. learning procedure kohonen feature maps similar competitive learning networks. main idea behind competitive learning simple;
