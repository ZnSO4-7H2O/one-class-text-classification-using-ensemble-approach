These methods are used when intelligence reports arrive which concerns different events which should be handled independently, when it is not known a priori to which event each intelligence report is related. We use clustering that runs as a back-end process to partition the intelligence into subsets representing the events, and in parallel, a fast classification that runs as a front-end process in order to put the newly arriving intelligence into its correct information fusion process.", "text": "abstract paper demonstrate possible manage intelligence constant time pre-process information fusion
