{"title": "Partnering Strategies for Fitness Evaluation in a Pyramidal Evolutionary  Algorithm", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper combines the idea of a hierarchical distributed genetic algorithm with different inter-agent partnering strategies. Cascading clusters of sub-populations are built from bottom up, with higher-level sub-populations optimising larger parts of the problem. Hence higher-level sub-populations search a larger search space with a lower resolution whilst lower-level sub-populations search a smaller search space with a higher resolution. The effects of different partner selection schemes for (sub-)fitness evaluation purposes are examined for two multiple-choice optimisation problems. It is shown that random partnering strategies perform best by providing better sampling and more diversity.", "text": "function optimisation discussed jong however slightly modified versions proved

distinct characteristics making different similar enough interesting comparison results. nurse-scheduling problem creating weekly schedules wards nurses major hospital. schedules satisfy working contracts meet demand given numbers nurses different grades shift whilst time seen fair staff concerned. latter objective achieved meeting many nurses’ requests possible considering historical information ensure unsatisfied requests unpopular shifts evenly distributed. various hospital policies nurse normally work subset theoretically possible shift-patterns. instance nurse work either days nights given week both. interested reader directed aickelin dowsland dowsland details problem. purposes problem modelled follows. nurses scheduled weekly ward basis work feasible pattern regards contract demand days nights qualification levels covered. total three qualification levels corresponding demand exist. hospital policy qualified nurses allowed cover less qualified one. infeasible

recent history patterns worked overall attractiveness pattern penalty cost allocated nurseshift-pattern pair. values close consultation hospital range bias lower values. values gives quality schedule. data sets available average problem size nurses ward possible shift-patterns nurse. second problem mall layout tenant selection problem; termed mall problem here. mall problem arises planning phase shopping centre completion type number shops occupying mall decided. maximise revenue good mixture shops heterogeneous homogeneous achieved. difficulty obtaining real-life data confidentiality problem data used research constructed artificially closely modelled actual real-life problem described instance bean following briefly outline model. objective mall problem maximise rent revenue mall. although small fixed rent shop large part shop’s rent depends sales revenue generated therefore important select right number size type tenants place right locations maximise revenue. outlined bean rent shop depends following factors problem modelled follows placing shops mall divided discrete number locations enough hold smallest shop size. larger sizes created placing shop type adjacent locations. hence problem placing shop-types locations shop-type belong groups location situated areas. type shop minimum ideal maximum number allowed mall consumers drawn mall balance variety homogeneity shops. onstraint ensures every nurse works exactly shift pattern his/her feasible constraint ensures demand nurses covered every grade every night. note definition higher graded nurses substituted lower grades necessary. typical problem dimensions nurses three grades shift patterns. thus integer programming formulation binary variables constraints. inally decoders fitness completed solutions calculated. unfortunately feasibility cannot guaranteed otherwise unlimited supply nurses respectively overtime would necessary. problem-specific issue cannot changed. therefore still need penalty function approach. since chosen encoding automatically satisfies constraint integer programming formulation following formula wdemand penalty weight calculate fitness solutions. hence penalty proportional number uncovered shifts fitness solution calculated follows. encoding follows directly integer programming individual represents full one-week schedule i.e. string elements number nurses. element string index shift pattern worked nurse example nurses string represents schedule nurse works pattern nurse pattern etc. comparison data sets attempted using standard integer programming

frequently solutions. straightforward genetic algorithm approach failed solve problem best evolutionary results date achieved indirect genetic approach employing decoder function however believe leverage direct evolutionary approaches within string rather subpopulations optimise different problem portions. hence higher-level sub-populations search larger search space lower resolution whilst lower-level sub-populations search smaller search space higher resolution. related hierarchical framework presented using genetic programming whereby main program trees coevolve successively lower

pyramidal approach best described hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm cascading clusters subpopulations built bottom higher-level subpopulations individuals loner strings optimise larger

remainder special crossover selects solution random sub-population performs fixedpoint crossover member population. remainder paper investigate ways improve previously found poor results suggesting ways combining partial strings intelligently. alternative particularly mall problem would gradual build-up sub-populations. without increasing overall population size would lead hence smaller sub-populations. however gradual approach might enabled algorithm find good feasible solutions slowly joining together promising building blocks. contrast relatively harsh two-level three-level design building blocks ‘succeed’ immediately. exploring exact benefits gradual build-up subsolutions would make another challenging area possible future research. problem pick partners noted competitive

pyramidal genetic algorithm optimising nurse scheduling mall problems. imilar nurse problem solution mall problem represented string many elements locations mall. element indicates shop-type located

sub-strings shops area them. combined create larger ‘parts’ mall finally full solutions. owever question arises calculate substitute fitness measure partial strings. solution chosen pseudo measure
