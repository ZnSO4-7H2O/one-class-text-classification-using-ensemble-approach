{"title": "Player co-modelling in a strategy board game: discovering how to play  fast", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "In this paper we experiment with a 2-player strategy board game where playing models are evolved using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The models are evolved to speed up automatic game development based on human involvement at varying levels of sophistication and density when compared to fully autonomous playing. The experimental results suggest a clear and measurable association between the ability to win games and the ability to do that fast, while at the same time demonstrating that there is a minimum level of human involvement beyond which no learning really occurs.", "text": "abstract. paper experiment -player strategy board game playing models evolved using reinforcement learning neural networks. models evolved speed automatic game development based human involvement varying levels sophistication density compared fully autonomous playing. experimental results suggest clear measurable association ability games ability fast time demonstrating minimum level human involvement beyond learning really occurs. paper shares setting-the-context paragraphs referenced papers submission author neither identical similar. said submission currently review made available demand editors inspection purposes. methodology experiments results duplicated. game data recorded potential examination reproducibility tests. data along game code available demand academic research purposes.", "year": 2006}
