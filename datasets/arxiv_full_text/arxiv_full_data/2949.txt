In this paper, we propose nearest prime simplicial complex approaches (NSC) by utilizing persistent homology to capture such structures. Assuming that each class is represented with a prime simplicial complex, we classify unlabeled samples based on the nearest projection distances from the samples to the simplicial complexes. We also extend the extrapolation ability of these complexes with a projection constraint term. Experiments in simulated and practical datasets indicate that compared with several published algorithms, the proposed NSC approaches achieve promising performance without losing the structure
