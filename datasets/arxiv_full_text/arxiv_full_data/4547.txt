The proposed approach is implemented using a decision tree based cascade hierarchical technique on the university hospital data for patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The preliminary results obtained show a satisfactory finding.", "text": "compliance coronary heart disease domain specific ontology based distributed architecture constructed work support knowledge
