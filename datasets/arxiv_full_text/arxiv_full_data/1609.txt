In this paper, we focus on the spoken language understanding pilot task, which consists of tagging a given utterance with speech acts and semantic slots. We compare different classifiers: the best system obtains 0.52 and 0.67 F1-scores on the test set for speech act recognition for the tourist and the guide respectively, and 0.52 F1-score for semantic tagging for both the guide and the tourist.", "text": "dialog state tracking challenge proposes several pilot tasks. paper focus spoken language understanding pilot task consists tagging given utterance speech acts semantic slots. compare different classiﬁers best system obtains f-scores test speech recognition tourist guide respectively f-score semantic tagging guide tourist. recognizing speech acts current utterance goals spoken language understanding pilot task. training development sets utterance annotated speech act. speech composed zero speech categories. speech category turn zero speech attributes. speech categories speech attributes. give details task. main approaches task presented submitted systems. systems best performing ones. system based support vector machine classiﬁer recognize speech acts features common unigrams bigrams trigrams well binary feature indicating whether current speaker different speaker last utterance. account history feature computed current previous utterance. classiﬁers trained speaker. kernel function well penalty parameter error term optimized -fold cross-validation. system similar logistic regression classiﬁer; moreover uses single speaker-independent model instead model speaker slightly improves results development set. systems assume utterance contains exactly speech category speech attribute therefore multiclass monolabel classiﬁers possible classes system based random forest classiﬁer features number question marks whether current speaker different speaker last utterance whether current speaker different speaker second previous utterance whether current speaker guide tourist. system designed predict speech categories speech attributes. system system except system features computed current previous utterances system features computed current previous second-to-previous utterances. semantic tagging second goal pilot task. tagged entity comprises several words. includes main categories contain subcategory relative modiﬁer from-to modiﬁer. ontology contains list subcategories relative modiﬁers from-to modiﬁers present main category. give details task. main approaches task presented semantic tagging system based conditional random ﬁelds implemented crfsuite library uses following features computed consecutive words case-insensitive unigrams last characters word whether ﬁrst letter word uppercase whether letters word uppercases whether word contains digit coarse-grained part-of-speech word ﬁne-grained part-of-speech word. four crfs trained independently types attributes main category subcategory relation from-to. combine output semantic ﬁrst generated sequence words tagged main category crf. thee attributes included semantic words tagged corresponding crfs value present main category according ontology. table presents results. acknowledgements authors would like warmly thank dstc team organizing challenge prompt respond emails. authors also grateful anonymous reviewers well walter chang valuable feedback.", "year": 2016}
