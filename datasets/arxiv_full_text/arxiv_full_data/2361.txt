{"title": "Variational Approximations between Mean Field Theory and the Junction  Tree Algorithm", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Recently, variational approximations such as the mean field approximation have received much interest. We extend the standard mean field method by using an approximating distribution that factorises into cluster potentials. This includes undirected graphs, directed acyclic graphs and junction trees. We derive generalized mean field equations to optimize the cluster potentials. We show that the method bridges the gap between the standard mean field approximation and the exact junction tree algorithm. In addition, we address the problem of how to choose the graphical structure of the approximating distribution. From the generalised mean field equations we derive rules to simplify the structure of the approximating distribution in advance without affecting the quality of the approximation. We also show how the method fits into some other variational approximations that are currently popular.", "text": "recently mean field approximation much interest. field method using approximating tribution includes tials. acyclic rected generalised derive timise cluster method bridges dard mean field approximation junction dress problem ture free parameters distribution. imating mean field equations derive plify approximation affecting class. variational currently context ingly interest jordan murphy advan­ tage methods provide approximation generalised-em contrast mean field approximation tractable pletely kullback-leibler optimisation equations drawback limited tion class. graphical fields work probabilistic lauritzen castillo ical structure larity knowledge. ference crease however means large intractable necessary. reason imation mating distributions tractable jordan wiegerinck haft wiegerinck paper tion present approximate tribution tion factorises generalised used iterative algorithm potentials exponential triangulated moralised halter lead intractable models even fully connected small. machine contain model clique variables approximating distributions variational approximated distribution distribution tribution interest. pute probabilities completely field) approach bution tractable approach factorises according mean marginals computationally since independent independent side independent vides unique solution potential global minimum tials sequence selected step. since conclude iteration local minimum mean field equations minor role zero desired. achieved 'pe-r amount shift affect generalized generalizes forwardly equations fully factorized contribution ishes fully factorized definition follow ning intersection clusters contained cluster successor tained another successor contained separator prede­ denote cessor {soc clso \"f}. separa­ contained define clda c/.. potentials target define cluster-set contain general potentials advance need optimised computational copied potentials fixing potentials adaptive. obviously important structure proximation approach fully adaptive tive approach distribution makes intractable. potentials compensated potentials parameters variational context paper subset clusters slightly tions 'directed' considered barber wiegerinck kappen ppp. eral framework written ters need ordering fine separator residual c))\"' <p\"' satisfy c])\"' c])\"' clusters connected fixed copies note optimal boltzmann machine target example hard coupled optimal approxi­ mation form c])<p given exp. convergences exp) recursively send messages except mes­ neighbours sage came. procedure junction tree consistent again since distributeevidence distribution global convergence structure mean field theory exact junction rithm. tractable barber ical optimisation respect bound kl-divergence. tion fixed point equations necessarily earity kappen numerical artificial substructures parent sets. target distributions size approximated butions results showed improve tion within pendent continuous section expositional ables continuous tional moid parameters conditional ditional parameters simple table entries. showed butions continuous. example -/�tanh. fixing 'subsidy' 'price' bound leads tractable upper bound sumed observed divergence details). function bound using optimised dotted) function probability conditional parameters exact graph). finding accurate bayesian cation large scale problems presented proximating given structure. tions using undirected junction tuned minimisation vergence. standard computation. question proximating target", "year": 2013}
