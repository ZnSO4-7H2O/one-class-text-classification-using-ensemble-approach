We describe a new modality/negation (MN) annotation scheme, the creation of a (publicly available) MN lexicon, and two automated MN taggers that we built using the annotation scheme and lexicon. Our annotation scheme isolates three components of modality and negation: a trigger (a word that conveys modality or negation), a target (an action associated with modality or negation) and a holder (an experiencer of modality). We describe how our MN lexicon was semi-automatically produced and we demonstrate that a structure-based MN tagger results in precision around 86% (depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set.  We apply our MN annotation scheme to statistical machine translation using a syntactic framework that supports the inclusion of semantic annotations. Syntactic tags enriched with semantic annotations are assigned to parse trees in the target-language training texts through a process of tree grafting. While the focus of our work is modality and negation, the tree grafting procedure is general and supports other types of semantic information. We exploit this capability by including named entities, produced by a pre-existing tagger, in addition to the MN elements produced by the taggers described in this paper. The resulting system significantly outperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the highest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English test set. This finding supports the hypothesis that both syntactic and semantic information can improve translation quality.", "text": "paper describes resourcesystem-building efforts eight-week johns hopkins

modality negation expressed without lexical trigger. typical declarative sentence default modality strong belief lexical trigger present. modality also expressed constructionally. example requirement

three modalities often transparent negation. example believe left sometimes means believe didn’t leave merging obviously simpliﬁcation saves annotators make difﬁcult decision. second linguistic simpliﬁcation related duality meaning require permit. requiring true similar meaning permitting false. thus annotators instructed label require true permit false. conversely permit true labeled require false. annotator chooses modality scoping modality negation takes place second decision. example sentence john tried annotator ﬁrst identiﬁes target modality chooses modality. finally annotator chooses false polarity target. third simpliﬁcation relates entailments modalities. many words complex meanings include components modality. example managed something tried probably wanted thus annotators provided speciﬁcity-ordered modality list figure asked choose ﬁrst applicable modality. note list corresponds independent entailment groupings ordered speciﬁcity inside entailment groupings ordering corresponds entailment relation e.g. succeeds occur tries occurred. also {requires entailment grouping taken speciﬁc {succeeds entailment grouping. moreover entailment groupings
