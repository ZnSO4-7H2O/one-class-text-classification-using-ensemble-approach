Both methods are based on conflicts between elements. These methods work with different type of elements (intelligence reports, vehicles, military units) on different hierarchical levels using specific conflict assessment methods on each level. We use Dempster-Shafer theory for conflict calculation between elements, Dempster-Shafer clustering for clustering these elements, and templates for classification. The result of these processes is a complete force aggregation on all levels handled.", "text": "paper present application together methods clustering classification force aggregation method. methods

aggregation minimize conflict. first find elements together using fast clustering method described clustering based important characteristics templates next level cluster result usually quite good average necessarily perfect. secondly classify together using templates clustering result described section types objects aggregated reports vehicles units e.g. reports aggregated vehicles. thus always assumed vehicle caused reports. furthermore vehicles clustered units; i.e. vehicles belong unit. finally size units aggregated larger units. different aspects conflicts depending characteristics objects. aspects report conflict could conflict regard type direction position. instead position conflict speed conflict calculating speed vehicle must travel order cause reports. physical conflict reports speed conflict. vehicle must travel greater speed physically possible order cause reports conflict reports. another physical conflict type conflict. conflict reports describe different types vehicles conflict report indicates unknown type. third type conflict direction conflict. reports describe vehicles traveling opposite directions conflict reports conflict travel direction. aggregation crucial combine correct possible combine elements correct higher element. many different comparison average number elements template face initial selection problem choosing elements combined together many different parallel aggregations figure secondly several different types templates must select template choose elements. obviously phases independent. choosing elements fuse together depends strongly template. must avoid combining elements match templates. case templates start control elements fuse? answer simple. nothing prevent theoretical point view unwise computational point view. order partition large elements groups fused prefer handle pairwise relations elements. templates usually relations elements would high computational load. instead pairwise distance measure pair elements important characteristics conflict measures intelligence vehicles respectively. violated conflict arises elements section different conflicts violated conditions combined dempster’s rule overall conflict elements serve actual distance measure clustering classification. direction conflict absolute conflict since possible vehicle change direction reports. assume reports describing identical vehicles close other. five reports describing vehicle moving south five reports describe vehicle moving north. likely vehicles caused reports instead one. minor variations directions allowed since vehicles instance might following non-straight road. also long time elapsed reports direction conflict becomes obsolete conf vehicle classifications hierarchically ordered tree unknown root specific vehicle types leaves. conflict function returns zero classification descendant otherwise returns one. used hierarchy shown figure parameter given speed value. knew maximum speed particular vehicle could travel given certain terrain could conflict values greater maximum speed. however case. impossible certainly possible. would also like express probable reports belong

vehicles unit also tend drive direction. clustering vehicles units consider direction. difficulty know vehicles every specific time. know been according reports. holds direction. instead plot vehicle
