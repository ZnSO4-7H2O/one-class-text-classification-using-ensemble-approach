{"title": "Decomposable Problems, Niching, and Scalability of Multiobjective  Estimation of Distribution Algorithms", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "The paper analyzes the scalability of multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MOEDAs) on a class of boundedly-difficult additively-separable multiobjective optimization problems. The paper illustrates that even if the linkage is correctly identified, massive multimodality of the search problems can easily overwhelm the nicher and lead to exponential scale-up. Facetwise models are subsequently used to propose a growth rate of the number of differing substructures between the two objectives to avoid the niching method from being overwhelmed and lead to polynomial scalability of MOEDAs.", "text": "paper analyzes scalability multiobjective estimation distribution algorithms class boundedly-diﬃcult additively-separable multiobjective optimization
