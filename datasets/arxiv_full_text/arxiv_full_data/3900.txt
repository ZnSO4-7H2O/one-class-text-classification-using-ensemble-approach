{"title": "Reliable Force Aggregation Using a Refined Evidence Specification from  Dempster-Shafer Clustering", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE", "I.2.3; I.2.6; I.5.3"], "abstract": "In this paper we develop methods for selection of templates and use these templates to recluster an already performed Dempster-Shafer clustering taking into account intelligence to template fit during the reclustering phase. By this process the risk of erroneous force aggregation based on some misplace pieces of evidence from the first clustering process is greatly reduced. Finally, a more reliable force aggregation is performed using the result of the second clustering. These steps are taken in order to maintain most of the excellent computational performance of Dempster-Shafer clustering, while at the same time improve on the clustering result by including some higher relations among intelligence reports described by the templates. The new improved algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n**3 log**2 n) compared to O(n**2 log**2 n) of standard Dempster-Shafer clustering using Potts spin mean field theory.", "text":
