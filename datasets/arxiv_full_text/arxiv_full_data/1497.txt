Recently, researchers have started to collect such datasets for languages other than English. An unexplored question is how different these datasets are from English and, if there are any differences, what causes them to differ. This paper provides a cross-linguistic comparison of Dutch, English, and German image descriptions. We find that these descriptions are similar in many respects, but the familiarity of crowd workers with the subjects of the images has a noticeable influence on description specificity.", "text":

deﬁniteness. frequent bigrams start description given table majority starts indeﬁnite article line familiarity theory deﬁniteness function definite articles refer familiar referents whereas indeﬁnite articles used unfamiliar referents distribution deﬁnite articles follows fact participants never seen images before context image referents could introduced. corollary systems trained data likely produce indeﬁnite deﬁnite articles need told deﬁnites used. negations. miltenburg performed corpus study categorize uses negations flickrk corpus. negations interesting descriptions describe images saying there. negations used something picture unexpected goes social norm non-visible factors relevant describe picture. annotators consistently negations seen evidence negated information part shared background knowledge strong ‘the kids wearing clothing.’ vrouw snijdt broodje zonder kijken ‘woman slices without looking’ examples german descriptions zwei buben ohne t-shirt setzen straße. ‘two boys without t-shirt sitting street.’ total found dutch german descriptions containing explicit negations corpus miltenburg found english images conﬁrms workers different languages mark negations approximately rate given sample size sentences. found almost images consistently attracted negations three languages found four examples co-occurring negation languages. image described speakers three languages using negation three images english german workers negations. racial ethnic marking. miltenburg found descriptions flickrk data skewed distribution racial ethnic markers annotators used terms like asian black much often white caucasian. disproportionate ethnicity markers dutch german conclude quirk english data systematic linguistic bias indeed non-white people often marked adjectives black darkskinned asian chinese. dutch german white people marked indicate contrast someone different ethnicity image. english data contains exceptions rule white individuals marked without people another ethnicity present image. note however ways indirectly mark someone white e.g. using adjectives like blonde brunette. figure shows venn-diagram race/ethnicity markers dutch english german. observe english german workers markers slightly often dutch workers. however claim evidence people living germany u.s.a. racist people living netherlands. rather trying interpret meaning difference different question drives people mention racial ethnic features? several reasons people mark race/ethnicity descriptions. common theme annotators mark images people dressed traditional outﬁts. examples include traditional dancers south-east asia scotsmen wearing kilts. items clothing meant signal part group annotators picked this. distribution labels explained terms markedness reporting bias explanation white seen unmarked default dominant ethnicity three countries. marker white used consistent modiﬁers within sentence. reasoning also explains observation miyazaki shimizu japanese crowd workers often used labels foreign overseas coco images. ﬁnal reason crowd workers mention ethnicity skin color images visually less interesting description task still demands workers provide description. workers thus pressured something worth mentioning image general descriptions might work rejected. general task effect implications beyond racial/ethnic marking. speculation. miltenburg also found annotators often beyond content images descriptions making unwarranted inferences pictures. dutch german crowd workers also make inferences conclude image descriptions three languages interpretations images necessarily true. observed unwarranted inferences throughout dutch german data especially women infants often seen mother. figure shows image dutch english german workers suggested woman grandmother. extreme case stewards pantsuits described german worker well-dressed lesben would undesirable model associate unseen images stewards lesbians. expect multiple descriptions alleviates type extreme example open question deal common types speculation. speakers dutch english german different backgrounds images familiar group others. familiarity enables speakers speciﬁc look three kinds examples differences familiarity lead differences description named entities objects sports. examples illustrative larger issue namely descriptions language adequate speakers another language discuss issue named entities dutch english german descriptions differ place entity names. study cases image likely familiar european workers likely familiar workers tuileries garden.

neither dutch german workers identiﬁed broncos jersey. three american workers also described activity image tailgating typical north-american phenomenon people gather enjoy informal meal parking outside sports found unfamiliarity different kinds sports leads misclassiﬁcation sports. focus three sports american football rugby soccer. looking images sports compared three different groups referred them. found german dutch groups patterned together deviating americrowd workers. expected dutch german workers make mistakes categorizing american football. seven pictures american football least dutch annotator thinks it’s game rugby. those least german annotator made mistake. contrast workers made mistakes identifying rugby images. three pictures rugby least american calling soccer football. images german annotator thought american football. soccer images universally recognized soccer. description speciﬁcity section observed annotators differ speciﬁcity descriptions familiarity depicted scenes objects. challenge image description systems right level speciﬁcity descriptions despite variation. system identify exact category object probably useful produce e.g. street organ rather unusual looking vehicle. besides familiarity also factors inﬂuencing label speciﬁcity. example cultures differences basic level; i.e. speciﬁc speakers generally expected reason appropriate label affenpinscher situations even though latter speciﬁc. ideally image description systems recognize general term detail sports stadium. concept prevalent dutch german culture dutch german word idiom collocation describe tailgating. ‘untranslatable’ concepts called lexical gaps. presence means dutch german workers concretely describe image without able relate depicted event abstract concept. familiarity also plays role labeling objects. consider figure shows street organ shopping street netherlands. dutch workers well german workers identiﬁed object street organ whereas english workers able provide general descriptions example illustrates strategies crowd provide descriptions unfamiliar objects signal unfamiliarity object using adjectives like strange unusual looking. similar ﬁnding miyazaki shimizu japanese crowd made frequent terms like foreign overseas western images coco. general cover term like vehicle. terms higher visual dispersion provide safe back-off strategy. late translation. using early translation image descriptions translated target language training image description system translated descriptions. using late translation image description system trained original data output translated. show former strategy achieves best result argue promising approach requires extra manual annotation. observations section show limits translation-based approach achieve. translation provides strong baseline capture phenomena familiar crowd providing descriptions. street organ example shows exists ‘knowledge gap’ dutch english. dutch users would certainly satisﬁed street organs labeled unusual looking vehicles. translation-based approach successful future research bridge gaps. focus germanic languages western world allow make general statements people describe images. comparison taxonomically culturally different languages might help uncover important factors missed study. surprising example comes baltaretu discuss writing direction affects people process recall visual scenes. implications images described speakers languages differing regard. finally limits corpus study show. phenomena described presented post-hoc explanations. plausible explanations still hypotheses. think hypotheses useful guides thinking image description still remain validated experimentally. marking ethnicity marking english workers also hold dutch german. dutch german workers also negations image descriptions showing robust phenomenon. dutch german workers also make unwarranted inferences images shows crowd workers regularly include extra-visual information descriptions. addition dutch german workers also disproportionately mark non-white people descriptions showing image description corpora carry biases need take account working data. also explored role familiarity image description. found images corpus easily described workers language unidentiﬁable workers another language. consequences image description models trained automatically translated training data images properly described target audience. problem general. success image description systems trained datasets described images limited knowledge annotators regardless language. available data useful learn discuss human-like descriptions look like take far. full coverage systems could tailor descriptions particular audiences still reach. hope work provides starting point conducting cross-linguistic comparisons image descriptions. future work includes replicating analyses across diverse families languages modifying task design contrast results ﬁndings using inspection tool explore linguistic phenomena. also interested scaling analyses larger corpora require development automated comparison methods. believe steps bring closer initial understanding diversity image
