{"title": "PCM and APCM Revisited: An Uncertainty Perspective", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "In this paper, we take a new look at the possibilistic c-means (PCM) and adaptive PCM (APCM) clustering algorithms from the perspective of uncertainty. This new perspective offers us insights into the clustering process, and also provides us greater degree of flexibility. We analyze the clustering behavior of PCM-based algorithms and introduce parameters $\\sigma_v$ and $\\alpha$ to characterize uncertainty of estimated bandwidth and noise level of the dataset respectively. Then uncertainty (fuzziness) of membership values caused by uncertainty of the estimated bandwidth parameter is modeled by a conditional fuzzy set, which is a new formulation of the type-2 fuzzy set. Experiments show that parameters $\\sigma_v$ and $\\alpha$ make the clustering process more easy to control, and main features of PCM and APCM are unified in this new clustering framework (UPCM). More specifically, UPCM reduces to PCM when we set a small $\\alpha$ or a large $\\sigma_v$, and UPCM reduces to APCM when clusters are confined in their physical clusters and possible cluster elimination are ensured. Finally we present further researches of this paper.", "text": "paper take look possibilistic c-means adaptive clustering algorithms perspective uncertainty. perspective offers insights clustering
