{"title": "Virtual Embodiment: A Scalable Long-Term Strategy for Artificial  Intelligence Research", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "68T01", "I.2.6"], "abstract": "Meaning has been called the \"holy grail\" of a variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from linguistics to philosophy, psychology and the neurosciences. The field of Artifical Intelligence (AI) is very much a part of that list: the development of sophisticated natural language semantics is a sine qua non for achieving a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Embodiment theories in cognitive science hold that human semantic representation depends on sensori-motor experience; the abundant evidence that human meaning representation is grounded in the perception of physical reality leads to the conclusion that meaning must depend on a fusion of multiple (perceptual) modalities. Despite this, AI research in general, and its subdisciplines such as computational linguistics and computer vision in particular, have focused primarily on tasks that involve a single modality. Here, we propose virtual embodiment as an alternative, long-term strategy for AI research that is multi-modal in nature and that allows for the kind of scalability required to develop the field coherently and incrementally, in an ethically responsible fashion.", "text": "meaning called holy grail variety scientiﬁc disciplines ranging linguistics philosophy psychology neurosciences ﬁeld artiﬁcal intelligence much part list development sophisticated natural language semantics sine achieving level intelligence comparable humans. embodiment theories cognitive science hold human semantic representation depends sensori-motor experience abundant evidence human meaning representation grounded perception physical reality leads conclusion meaning must depend fusion multiple modalities despite this research general subdisciplines computational linguistics computer vision particular focused primarily tasks involve single modality. here propose virtual embodiment alternative long-term strategy research multi-modal nature allows kind scalability required develop ﬁeld coherently incrementally ethically responsible fashion. embodiment theory implies best acquiring human-level semantics machines learn experience want teach system true meaning bumping wall simply bump walls repeatedly. although scenario shares similarities human language acquisition viable route current machine learning paradigms allow required rate learning make scenario feasible. modern state-of-the-art deep learning systems requiring millions samples solve highly speciﬁc tasks trivial humans reasonable speculate would take much longer human lifespan physically embodied agent develop extensive linguistic capabilities current technology. conjecture limitations apply much lesser extent agent virtually embodied. virtual embodiment mean agents collectively individually acquire semantics embodied virtual rather physical world. concretely rather physical robot learn understand world physically bumping physical walls would virtual agents bump virtual walls virtual world. virtual embodiment offers several advantages scalability incremental development complexity virtual worlds develop conjunction i.e. scale capabilities artiﬁcial agents. allows stepwise development towards general machine intelligence rather aiming end-goal without concrete understanding challenges consequences face attempting reach end-goal. long-term feasibility performance ceiling agent function complexity virtual environment. virtual worlds initially overly complex grow complexity technology develops. allows focused long-term research strategy feasible remain challenging years decades come. rapid iteration fact artiﬁcial agents constrained arbitrary parameters means development happen rapidly iteratively agents learning interacting humans other. rather extremes either system solve small uni-modal tasks instead trying solve whole problem single attempt improve iteratively agile fashion great speed. requirement continuous human involvement although interaction necessary embodied learning virtual interactions need require human involvement step rather happen agents themselves. unburdens humans foregoing need constant supervised signal currently often seen machine learning applications also facilitates rapid development. ethical testability importantly since artiﬁcial agents exposed constrained environment virtual worlds provide ultimate testing ground carefully ﬂeshing important ethical considerations relation artiﬁcial intelligence without potentially damaging immediate consequences physical world. reasons propose virtual embodiment best feasible strategies instigating stepwise development towards artiﬁcial general intelligence. particular advocate development video games purpose facilitate virtual embodiment. follows brieﬂy outline background proposal explain video games suitable current purposes list desiderata virtual embodiment-compatible video games facilitate research artiﬁcial intelligence. fundamental problem semantics grounding problem concerns circularity deﬁning meaning symbol symbols. context searle’s famous chinese room argument phrased possible learn chinese nothing chinese dictionary?
