{"title": "Evaluation for Uncertain Image Classification and Segmentation", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "I.4; I.5"], "abstract": "Each year, numerous segmentation and classification algorithms are invented or reused to solve problems where machine vision is needed. Generally, the efficiency of these algorithms is compared against the results given by one or many human experts. However, in many situations, the location of the real boundaries of the objects as well as their classes are not known with certainty by the human experts. Furthermore, only one aspect of the segmentation and classification problem is generally evaluated. In this paper we present a new evaluation method for classification and segmentation of image, where we take into account both the classification and segmentation results as well as the level of certainty given by the experts. As a concrete example of our method, we evaluate an automatic seabed characterization algorithm based on sonar images.", "text": "year numerous segmentation classiﬁcation algorithms invented reused

segmentation encountered satellite sonar imaging important data classify types soils present images instance build maps. amount images gathered mission important automatic recognition algorithms relieve human operators. since swath sensor wide many types soils encountered within single image classiﬁcation must done local neighborhood. neighborhood either limited single pixel often small tile

especially hard interpret many imperfections reconstruct image huge number parameters taken account data polluted large amount sensor noise. plus phenomena multipath signal propagation speckle presence fauna ﬂora augment diﬃculty interpretation image. consequently diﬀerent experts propose diﬀerent classiﬁcations image. thus order evaluate automatic classiﬁcation must take account difference
