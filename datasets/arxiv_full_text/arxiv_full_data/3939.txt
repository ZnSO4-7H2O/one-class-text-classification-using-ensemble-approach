{"title": "May We Have Your Attention: Analysis of a Selective Attention Task", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "In this paper we present a deeper analysis than has previously been carried out of a selective attention problem, and the evolution of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to solve it. We show that the task has a rich structure, and agents must solve a variety of subproblems to perform well. We consider the relationship between the complexity of an agent and the ease with which it can evolve behavior that generalizes well across subproblems, and demonstrate a shaping protocol that improves generalization.", "text": "paper present deeper analysis previously carried selective attention problem evolution continuous-time recurrent neural networks solve show task rich structure

-interneuron agents suggests -interneuron architectures likely evolve good solutions. producing range behaviors simple architecture requires precise therefore brittle combination parameters though tentative explanation needs work support improving generalization modifying trials agent sees training increase performance subproblem hopefully allowing greater generalization. agent exposed surprisingly small number trials throughout evolution. agent always evaluated trials. trials added replacing trial agent best training agent introduced trial performing around generations last trial

valid solution formed remainder selected group randomly generated trials first found cause current topperforming agent fail added. informal observation says unusual trials generated agent fails one. thus reasonable upper bound number trials agent encounter training large variety subproblems many quite rare. example unseen passing subproblem occurs time. extreme rarity expected number unseen
