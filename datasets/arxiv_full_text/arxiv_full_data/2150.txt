Well, that is what we test in this project, comparing XGBoost trained on human engineered features to training directly on data. The human engineered features do not outperform XGBoost trained di- rectly on the data, but they are comparable. This project con- tributes a novel method for utilizing human created classifi- cation models on high dimensional datasets.", "text": "used multiple kaggle competitions. xgboost model trained transformed data results compared training xgboost untransformed data. restricted using xgboost machine learning approaches also work tested linear perceptrons linear regression support vector machines. pair dimensions selected training dataset centered normalized dimensions. training dataset contains samples. pairs selected based correlation dimensions. correlation easier identify clusters data points. dimensions dataset used workers. worker given scatterplot dimensions proceeds draw polygons separate data classiﬁcation regions. polygon classiﬁes sample class simplicity polygon rectangle making models similar produced model evaluated test dataset producing accuracy score classiﬁcation regions equation samples contained polygon contribute accuracy score. test dataset contains samples. ever looked machine learning classiﬁcation model thought could made that? well test project comparing xgboost trained human engineered features training directly data. human engineered features outperform xgboost trained directly data comparable. project contributes novel method utilizing human created classiﬁcation models high dimensional datasets. artiﬁcial intelligence machine learning human computation ﬁelds little research effectiveness human generated models. research project human guided simple search tabu search humans outperform state algorithms solving complex visual problems travelling salesman problem numerous machine learning algorithms np-complete harder cover machine breakthroughs achieved including humans-in-the-loop hard optimization combinatorial problems promising results need investigation human guided machine learning. machine learning algorithms typically work high dimensional datasets human cannot visualize entirity. high dimensionality dataset insurmountable obstacle effectively using human-in-theloop. project dimension subset approach test human effectiveness creating classiﬁcation models. instead human attempt high dimensional visualization humans design models pairs dimensions. models used transform dataset feature space. xgboost short extreme gradient boosting popular machine learning library copyright association advancement artiﬁcial intelligence rights reserved. xgboost trained subset samples used classify remaining samples. perform fair comparison dimensions used workers included untransformed samples. example dataset dimensions dimensions used xgboost model trained matrix. thus xgboost model trained untransformed samples data matrix) another transformed samples feature matrix). progress gives feedback accuracy model. accuracy calculated validation dataset xvalid. validation dataset contains samples. models achieve accuracy accepted provide quality control. payment. datasets binary classiﬁcation tasks. datasets consist synthetic clustering task rest real world datasets kaggle. datasets highly unbalanced balance datasets equal number classes. additionally exception synthetic dataset dimensions consist nominal continuous variables. summary table accuracy results training xgboost directly data features produced workers. total number samples. number samples training dataset. m-m’ number samples test dataset. number dimensions used workers. number models workers created number features generated. table demonstrates results training xgboost directly data well features generated workers. xgboost’s model parameterized cross validation. parameters learning rate tree depth number rounds we’ve shown human guided machine learning crowd sourced workers drawing polygons scatterplots. models outperform standard algorithmic approaches comparable. contribution project human model creation high dimensional datasets. future research discover human produced models outperform purely algorithmic approaches. research human produced models outperform algorithmic approaches likely loss information. transforming data using models reduces data granularity. ahead preserve granularity using human produced models.", "year": 2016}
