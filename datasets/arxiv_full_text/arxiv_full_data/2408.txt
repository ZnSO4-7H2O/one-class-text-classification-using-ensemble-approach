{"title": "Active Diagnosis via AUC Maximization: An Efficient Approach for  Multiple Fault Identification in Large Scale, Noisy Networks", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "The problem of active diagnosis arises in several applications such as disease diagnosis, and fault diagnosis in computer networks, where the goal is to rapidly identify the binary states of a set of objects (e.g., faulty or working) by sequentially selecting, and observing, (noisy) responses to binary valued queries. Current algorithms in this area rely on loopy belief propagation for active query selection. These algorithms have an exponential time complexity, making them slow and even intractable in large networks. We propose a rank-based greedy algorithm that sequentially chooses queries such that the area under the ROC curve of the rank-based output is maximized. The AUC criterion allows us to make a simplifying assumption that significantly reduces the complexity of active query selection (from exponential to near quadratic), with little or no compromise on the performance quality.", "text": "problem active diagnosis arises several applications disease diagnosis fault diagnosis computer networks goal rapidly identify binary states objects sequentially
