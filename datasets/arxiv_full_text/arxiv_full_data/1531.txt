{"title": "Understanding Rating Behaviour and Predicting Ratings by Identifying  Representative Users", "tag": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Online user reviews describing various products and services are now abundant on the web. While the information conveyed through review texts and ratings is easily comprehensible, there is a wealth of hidden information in them that is not immediately obvious. In this study, we unlock this hidden value behind user reviews to understand the various dimensions along which users rate products. We learn a set of users that represent each of these dimensions and use their ratings to predict product ratings. Specifically, we work with restaurant reviews to identify users whose ratings are influenced by dimensions like 'Service', 'Atmosphere' etc. in order to predict restaurant ratings and understand the variation in rating behaviour across different cuisines. While previous approaches to obtaining product ratings require either a large number of user ratings or a few review texts, we show that it is possible to predict ratings with few user ratings and no review text. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms other conventional methods by 16-27% in terms of RMSE.", "text": "online user reviews describing various products services abundant web. information conveyed review texts ratings easily comprehensible wealth hidden information immediately obvious. study unlock hidden value behind user reviews understand various dimensions along users rate

predict restaurant ratings understand variation rating behaviour across different cuisines. previous approaches obtaining product ratings require either large number user ratings review texts show possible predict ratings user ratings review text. experiments show approach outperforms conventional methods terms rmse. advent large number platforms including e-commerce sites discussion forums blogs etc. emerged allow users express opinions regarding various businesses products services. opinions usually form reviews consisting text feedback describing various aspects product along single numeric rating representing users’ oversentiment user review ratings normally aggregated provide overall product rating help people form opinion help make informed decision purchase. however case products time delay till sufﬁcient number ratings give ‘complete picture’ product obtained. scenario seller product useful identify people whose ratings combined together reﬂect ‘complete picture’. seller invite people review product result reduce time delay involved getting ‘true’ product rating. review text unstructured inherently noisy. valuable source information since users justify ratings text users tend express sentiments different aspects product review text provide rating based combination sentiments however users inﬂuenced heavily particular aspect product reﬂected ratings. example reviewing smartphones ratings provided user inﬂuenced heavily batterylife irrespective quality aspects phone. similarly reviewing restaurants users’ ratings correlate ambience restaurant level service provided. call users ‘representative users’ since ratings tend ‘represent’ particular dimension product. previous works attempted combine review text ratings. approach combines latent topics obtained review text users’ rating data learn representative users product. enables predict ratings products looking ratings small users even review text available. traditional methods product ratings obtained modelling product factors ratings data. however suggest approach accurate case products lack sufﬁcient number ratings. they turn propose model product factors review texts. approach free constraints.

example people visit french restaurants care food service value money? different people visit italian restaurants? rest paper structured follows. section provides review related work. section

text ratings however review segmentation method differs work depends manual annotation review sentence predetermined domain-speciﬁc aspects training separate classiﬁers aspect. furthermore capture variation exist within domain. example aspects affect ratings french restaurants ‘deserts’ etc.) different indian restaurants ‘variety’ etc.). approach problem segmentation measuring overlap between sentence review seed words describing aspect. however aspect seed words chosen manually again domain-speciﬁc. topic models normally used make segmentation task transferable across different domains. problem mapping topics aspects studied explicit aspect ratings form weak supervision identify rated aspects manually selected aspect seed words form weak supervision. remove dependence aspect ratings aspect seed words develop model captures aspects using sentiment seed words present unsupervised method extracting aspects automatically deriving sentiment seed words review text. important note latent topics obtain explicit aspects since necessary ﬁnal goal. rating prediction authors build recommendation system using combination latent dimensions obtained rating data latent topics obtained review text. dataset preprocessing yelp challenge dataset consisting around million reviews restaurants across countries. reviews provided users. reviews contain single star rating text author etc. details restaurants like average star rating categories etc. also available. segment restaurants according category since would like better understand variation exists across different cuisines. note

obtained shows variation exists among different cuisines. example indian restaurants ‘flavour’ ‘variety’ topics; italian restaurants ‘drinks’; french restaurants ‘drinks’ ‘dessert’ topics. greek restaurants ‘cooking style’ topic words like fresh cooked soft tender etc. also certain words like table minute time wait hour seated etc. appear together case french italian restaurants signaling perhaps long wait seated restaurants. performed around reviews indian restaurants reviews italian restaurants reviews french restaurants sentence assigned latent topics. sentiment analysis conducted user-topic correlation matrix obtained restaurant category. using user-topic correlation matrix segment users according latent topic. figure shows number representative users topic different correlation thresholds sake clarity show latent topics could interpreted interesting observe people visit indian restaurants tend care ‘location’ ‘value least ‘service’ ‘atmosphere’. hand people visit french restaurants care ‘food ‘food least ‘atmosphere’. similarly providing ratings number users inﬂuenced ‘atmosphere’ greek restaurants ‘food’. proceed obtain latent topic ratings restaurant. purpose select users whose correlation threshold representative users. latent topic average ratings provided users obtain topic ratings therefore possible obtain crude ratings aspects like ‘food’ ‘service’ etc. give indication quality aspects. evaluation evaluate performance rating prediction determine rmse actual predicted ratings italian restaurants. compare rmse mg-lda online described case detect topics previous works. latent topic ratings restaurants training restaurants test. results shown table rmse obtained using mglda kernel. restaurant average representative users. inviting users rate restaurants would help predicting ‘true’ restaurant rating however conventional methods average ratings without taking account different topics represent. approach gives rmse approach outperforms method also since people provide rating rating restaurants predicting constant rating every time also give reasonable result. predicting rating every time results rmse approach outperforms constant classiﬁer summary show latent topics review text could used unlock hidden value user reviews. utilise intuition that rating products certain users inﬂuenced heavily particular aspect product. learn users detecting sentiments expressed regard latent topic comparing sentiments actual ratings provided. also draw interesting insights regarding users’ rating behaviour across different cuisines obtain latent topic ratings restaurants. overall ratings take account different dimensions restaurant obtained using regression model. future would like show approach transferable domains like ecommerce. also would interesting segregate reviews star ratings would help understand factors restaurant getting right getting wrong. example dimensions corresponding review text -star ratings would different
