The invariants we present are in some sense complete and we describe an algorithm to calculate them, giving explicit computations up to order six. We present an application to online (stroke-trajectory based) character recognition. This seems to be the first time in the literature that the use of iterated integrals of a curve is proposed for (invariant) feature extraction in machine learning applications.", "text": "introduce novel class rotation invariants dimensional curves based iterated integrals. invariants present sense complete describe algorithm calculate them giving explicit computations order six. present application online character recognition. seems ﬁrst time literature iterated integrals curve proposed feature extraction machine learning applications. data represented curve dimensional euclidean space appears many areas pattern analysis. boundary object image video recording stored dimensional curve. used example object recognition everyday objects mapping photographs terrain maps solving jigsaw puzzles video recordings path persons ﬁeld vision analyzed detect anomalous behavior predict future moves hand gestures also naturally describe trajectories larger scale travel path usually person vehicel environment easily recovered time stamped location data given example either recordings derived mobile connectivity logs. monograph overview applications context. online character recognition input stream usually trajectory pen-movements example survey applications ﬁxed coordinate system orient data becomes important select features data invariant rotation input. example online character recognition thinking multiuser tablets angle device used ﬁxed. fact taken account extracting features recognition task. construction rotation invariants images long history. starting work usually based moments image. drew connection classical problem algebraic invariants modern treatment) ∗diehlmath.tu-berlin.de able explicitly calculate seven invariants. subsequent work several diﬀerent methods deriving invariants proposed among zernike moments fouriermellin transform algebra methods work using complex moments inspired method present. rotation invariant feature selection two-dimensional curves also treated right. among techniques fourier series wavelets curvature based methods integral invariants also mention works codons primal curvature sketch freeman chains usually rotation invariant. invariants present based iterated integrals curve usually denoted signature. signature object study ﬁrst introduced chen showed curve almost completely characterized recent generalization). importance iterated integrals become evident areas control theory ordinary diﬀerential equations stochastic analysis paper structured follows. section deﬁne iterated integrals introduce algebraic notations deal them. section containts main results give means calculate rotation invariants based signature. section carry explicit computations invariants order taking care algebraic independence. finally section prove concept apply simple character recognition problem. brieﬂy mention advantages using iterated integrals feature extraction. curvature based methods rely computation second derivative whereas calculation iterated integrals needs ﬁrst derivative signal. latter course stable procedure. fact stability iterated integrals goes beyond fact since compute even signals nowhere diﬀerentiable;
