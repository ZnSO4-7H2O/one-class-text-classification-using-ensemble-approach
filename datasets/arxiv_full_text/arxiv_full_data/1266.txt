{"title": "Towards automated patient data cleaning using deep learning: A  feasibility study on the standardization of organ labeling", "tag": ["physics.med-ph", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "Data cleaning consumes about 80% of the time spent on data analysis for clinical research projects. This is a much bigger problem in the era of big data and machine learning in the field of medicine where large volumes of data are being generated. We report an initial effort towards automated patient data cleaning using deep learning: the standardization of organ labeling in radiation therapy. Organs are often labeled inconsistently at different institutions (sometimes even within the same institution) and at different time periods, which poses a problem for clinical research, especially for multi-institutional collaborative clinical research where the acquired patient data is not being used effectively. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically identify each organ in the CT image and then label it with the standardized nomenclature presented at AAPM Task Group 263. We tested this model on the CT images of 54 patients with prostate and 100 patients with head and neck cancer who previously received radiation therapy. The model achieved 100% accuracy in detecting organs and assigning standardized labels for the patients tested. This work shows the feasibility of using deep learning in patient data cleaning that enables standardized datasets to be generated for effective intra- and interinstitutional collaborative clinical research.", "text": "figure represents composite image patient head neck cancer mandible pixel intensity organ masks pixel intensity represents corresponding slice patient organs contoured labeled. figure shows accuracy model reported identifying organs head neck cases different learning rates shows cross-entropy loss achieved model four learning rates. figure presents visualization model weight clusters learning rates space three modes. show initial random weights runs show paritally learned weights completion convolutional step show final weights computed fully-connected layers finished learning. authority errors radiation therapy pennsylvania patient safety advisory bergstra bengio random search hyper-parameter optimization journal machine learning kingma adam method stochastic optimization arxiv preprint arxiv. krizhevsky sutskever hinton imagenet classification deep convolutional neural networks mildenberger eichelberg martin introduction dicom standard eur. radiol. monge matching algorithms within duplicate detection system ieee data eng.bull. gustafsson gustafsson national approach automated collection standardized population-based radiation therapy data sweden radiotherapy oncology rahm data cleaning problems current approaches ieee data eng.bull. raman vand hellerstein potter's wheel interactive data cleaning system vldb roski bo-linn andrews creating value health care data opportunities michalski eliminating inconsistencies simulation treatment planning orders radiation therapy international journal radiation oncology* biology* physics steinwart iand christmann support vector machines springer science business media) tang data cleaning asia-pacific conference springer) wickham tidy data journal statistical software wold esbensen geladi principal component analysis chemometrics intellig. lab. syst.", "year": 2017}
