{"title": "A New Clustering Algorithm Based Upon Flocking On Complex Network", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "physics.soc-ph"], "abstract": "We have proposed a model based upon flocking on a complex network, and then developed two clustering algorithms on the basis of it. In the algorithms, firstly a \\textit{k}-nearest neighbor (knn) graph as a weighted and directed graph is produced among all data points in a dataset each of which is regarded as an agent who can move in space, and then a time-varying complex network is created by adding long-range links for each data point. Furthermore, each data point is not only acted by its \\textit{k} nearest neighbors but also \\textit{r} long-range neighbors through fields established in space by them together, so it will take a step along the direction of the vector sum of all fields. It is more important that these long-range links provides some hidden information for each data point when it moves and at the same time accelerate its speed converging to a center. As they move in space according to the proposed model, data points that belong to the same class are located at a same position gradually, whereas those that belong to different classes are away from one another. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the rates of convergence of clustering algorithms are fast enough. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "text": "proposed model based upon ﬂocking complex network developed

moving distances larger makes approach centers quickly. process causes situation boundary points worse distances boundary points neighbors increased time actions moving distances decreased further. however long-range connections added network beginning actions data points experience larger rate converging center accelerated. important long-range connections provide information distribution
