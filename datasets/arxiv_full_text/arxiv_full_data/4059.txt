{"title": "Segmentation of Offline Handwritten Bengali Script", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Character segmentation has long been one of the most critical areas of optical character recognition process. Through this operation, an image of a sequence of characters, which may be connected in some cases, is decomposed into sub-images of individual alphabetic symbols. In this paper, segmentation of cursive handwritten script of world's fourth popular language, Bengali, is considered. Unlike English script, Bengali handwritten characters and its components often encircle the main character, making the conventional segmentation methodologies inapplicable. Experimental results, using the proposed segmentation technique, on sample cursive handwritten data containing 218 ideal segmentation points show a success rate of 97.7%. Further feature-analysis on these segments may lead to actual recognition of handwritten cursive Bengali script.", "text": "million people eastern india bangladesh bengali script communication. urgent need development systems capable handling handwritten bengali script. involving printed bengali script already addressed problems related hand written bengali script still constitute unexplored area research. segmentation subsequent analysis handwritten bengali script challenging pattern recognition problem. firstly vocabulary large. modern bengali script alphabet consists vowels consonants secondly bengali characters complex. thirdly many bengali characters look similar great pattern variations samples character written person. characters script horizontal lines called head-lines. cursive writing head-lines mostly join another word word appears single component hanging head line. bengali script vowel followed consonant takes modified shape placed left right bottom consonant depending vowel. modified shapes often overlap encircle original character. shapes characters combine original character called compound characters. consonant vowel following consonant often takes compound orthographic shape termed compound character. modified shapes around compound characters bengali script paper hybrid model image based dissection recognition based segmentation proposed. image based dissection approach segments identified based ‘character-like’ properties meaningful components bstract character segmentation long critical areas optical character recognition process. operation image sequence characters connected cases decomposed sub-images individual alphabetic symbols. segmentation cursive handwritten script world’s fourth popular language bengali considered. unlike english script bengali handwritten characters components often encircle main conventional segmentation methodologies inapplicable. experimental results using proposed segmentation technique sample cursive handwritten data containing ideal segmentation points show success rate feature-analysis segments lead actual recognition handwritten cursive bengali script. introduction character segmentation important decision processes optical character recognition isolating individual alphabetic characters script image often significant enough make decisive contribution towards success rate overall system. system designed work either on-line off-line purposes. on-line systems collect input data recording order strokes made write electronic bit-pad off-line systems recording pixel pixel digital image entire writing digital scanner. wide field application covering handwritten document transcription automatic mail address recognition machine processing bankchecks faxes etc. off-line hand written words long active area important contributions made field involve analysis english texts chinese script arabic characters background research present work considers bengali script developing suitable techniques off-line system approach propose paper several favorable practical advantages. designed work general handwriting styles mixed combinations discrete cursive handwritten bengali scripts. overall design modular module fine tuned replaced improved versions without major impact modules. isolated line scanned vertically vertical pixel density histogram generated. comparing column-wise intensity histogram predefine threshold word segmentation boundaries identified format analysis isolated words subdivided four horizontal imaginary regions selection regions based basic characteristics bengali script. experimental analysis reveals bengali script character components modified shapes extend headline actual characters. components extend head-line called ascendants character components modified shapes actual character called descendents. ascendants normally region- whereas descendents generally region- main character body dominated region- region-. format analysis algorithm divides input word data regions. line segmentation threshold chosen carefully classify region- region- successive lines. segmentation process capture data handwritten document conventional flatbed scanner resolution used. database collected research words written plain white sheet paper black gave clear stroke sharp edges. collected data assumed slope corrected. pre-processing several pre-processing steps done composite image actual segmentation process starts. firstly input scanned image converted corresponding binary equivalent data. following submodules subsequently attempt classify input data. word segmentation basic objective step segment scanned image page isolated words. single scanned image contain several lines data line subsequently contains several disjoint words. basic word segmentation algorithm scans input image horizontally;
