{"title": "Generative Choreography using Deep Learning", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MM", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the extraction of high-level features from raw sensor data which has opened up new possibilities in many different fields, including computer generated choreography. In this paper we present a system chor-rnn for generating novel choreographic material in the nuanced choreographic language and style of an individual choreographer. It also shows promising results in producing a higher level compositional cohesion, rather than just generating sequences of movement. At the core of chor-rnn is a deep recurrent neural network trained on raw motion capture data and that can generate new dance sequences for a solo dancer. Chor-rnn can be used for collaborative human-machine choreography or as a creative catalyst, serving as inspiration for a choreographer.", "text": "recent advances deep learning enabled extraction
