{"title": "A Poisson convolution model for characterizing topical content with word  frequency and exclusivity", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "stat.ME", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "An ongoing challenge in the analysis of document collections is how to summarize content in terms of a set of inferred themes that can be interpreted substantively in terms of topics. The current practice of parametrizing the themes in terms of most frequent words limits interpretability by ignoring the differential use of words across topics. We argue that words that are both common and exclusive to a theme are more effective at characterizing topical content. We consider a setting where professional editors have annotated documents to a collection of topic categories, organized into a tree, in which leaf-nodes correspond to the most specific topics. Each document is annotated to multiple categories, at different levels of the tree. We introduce a hierarchical Poisson convolution model to analyze annotated documents in this setting. The model leverages the structure among categories defined by professional editors to infer a clear semantic description for each topic in terms of words that are both frequent and exclusive. We carry out a large randomized experiment on Amazon Turk to demonstrate that topic summaries based on the FREX score are more interpretable than currently established frequency based summaries, and that the proposed model produces more efficient estimates of exclusivity than with currently models. We also develop a parallelized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler that allows the inference to scale to millions of documents.", "text": "units. goal analysis fold. first desire develop joint model observations {wd×v ld×k} used project data onto low-dimensional parameter space interpretability maintained mapping categories directions length document given normalize average document length documents unrestricted membership combination topics represented vector labels i{doc belongs topic afﬁnity. speciﬁcally odds topic label active document bernoulli). conditional labels topic memberships relative sizes document’s afﬁnity active topics zero inactive topics since child rates forced similar parameters also regularized pushed toward baseline value /|s|. explore regularization structure model empirically section taken topics parameters given observed data. speciﬁcally inference conditioned matrix word counts matrix topic labels d-vector document lengths tree structure topics. factors given other. side conditional posterior rate variance parameters other conditional posterior topic afﬁnity parameters {ξd}d document given hyperparameters rate parameters {µf}v topic name corporate/industrial strategy/plans legal/judicial regulation/policy share listings performance accounts/earnings comment/forecasts insolvency/liquidity funding/capital share capital bonds/debt issues loans/credits credit ratings ownership changes mergers/acquisitions asset transfers privatisations production/services products/services research/development capacity/facilities markets/marketing domestic markets external markets market share advertising/promotion contracts/orders defence contracts monopolies/competition management management moves labour economics economic performance monetary/economic money supply inflation/prices consumer prices wholesale prices consumer finance personal income consumer credit retail sales government finance expenditure/revenue government borrowing output/capacity industrial production capacity utilization inventories employment/labour unemployment trade/reserves balance payments merchandise trade reserves housing starts leading indicators topic name government/social european community internal market corporate policy agriculture policy monetary/economic institutions environment issues competition/subsidy external relations general crime enforcement defence international relations disasters accidents arts culture entertainment environment natural world fashion health labour issues millennium issues obituaries human interest domestic politics biographies personalities people religion science technology sports travel tourism civil elections weather welfare social services markets equity markets bond markets money markets interbank markets forex markets commodity markets soft commodities metals trading energy markets figure comparison word/topic metrics proposed model ﬁtted topics. scatterplots show maximum exclusivity across topics variance word rates across topics constant loess smoother red. figure comparison word/topic metrics proposed model ﬁtted topics. scatterplots show maximum exclusivity across topics variance word rates across topics constant loess smoother red.", "year": 2012}
