{"title": "Automated Coin Recognition System using ANN", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Coins are integral part of our day to day life. We use coins everywhere like grocery store, banks, buses, trains etc. So it becomes a basic need that coins can be sorted and counted automatically. For this it is necessary that coins can be recognized automatically. In this paper we have developed an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) based Automated Coin Recognition System for the recognition of Indian Coins of denomination Rs. 1, 2, 5 and 10 with rotation invariance. We have taken images from both sides of coin. So this system is capable of recognizing coins from both sides. Features are extracted from images using techniques of Hough Transformation, Pattern Averaging etc. Then, the extracted features are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. 97.74% recognition rate has been achieved during the experiments i.e. only 2.26% miss recognition, which is quite encouraging.", "text": "electromagnetic method based systems differentiate different materials systems coins passed oscillating coil certain frequency different materials bring different changes amplitude direction frequency. changes parameters like diameter thickness weight magnetism used differentiate coins. electromagnetic method based coin recognition systems improve accuracy recognition still fooled game coins. recent years coin recognition systems based images also come picture. systems first image coin recognized taken either camera scanning. images processed using various techniques image processing like gabor wavelets edge detection segmentation image subtraction decision trees various features extracted images. based features different coins recognized. minoru fukumi presented rotational invariant neural pattern recognition system coin recognition. performed experiments using coin coin. work created multilayered neural network preprocessor consisting many slabs neurons provide rotation invariance. extended work tried achieve accuracy coins. work used design neural network coin recognition. adnan khashman presented intelligent coin identification system icis uses neural network pattern averaging recognizing rotated coins various degrees. shows correct identification i.e. variably rotated coin images correctly identified. mohamed roushdy used generalized hough transform detect coins image. work combined hough transform pattern averaging extract features image. then features used recognize coins. section implementation details given. section presented training testing data. then section experimental results provided. then section concluded work. abstract coins integral part life. coins everywhere like grocery store banks buses trains etc. becomes basic need coins sorted counted automatically. necessary coins recognized automatically. paper developed based automated coin recognition system recognition indian coins denomination rotation invariance. taken images sides coin. system capable recognizing coins sides. features extracted hough transformation pattern averaging etc. then extracted features passed input trained neural network. recognition rate achieved experiments i.e. miss recognition quite encouraging. introduction imagine life without coins. coins daily life almost everywhere like banks supermarkets grocery stores etc. integral part life. basic need highly accurate efficient automatic coin recognition system. in-spite daily uses coin recognition systems also used research purpose institutes organizations deal ancient coins. three types coin recognition systems available market based different methods mechanical method based systems parameters like diameter radius thickness weight magnetism coin differentiate coins. parameters used differentiate different materials coins. means provide coins original fake diameter thickness weight magnetism different materials mechanical method based coin recognition system treat coins original coin systems fooled easily. based center coordinates radius coin extracted background. shadow coin removed. fig. shows coin shadow fig. shows coin without shadow applying hough transform. trimmed coin images become input trained neural network. reduce computation complexity neural network images reduced size segmenting image using segments size pixels taking average pixel values within segment. represented mathematical equations shown first step coin recognition process. step coin image acquired. indian coins denominations scanned sides using color scanner shown fig. five coins denomination scanned. first step image -bit image. image processing colored images takes time grayscale images. reduce time required processing images steps good convert -bit image -bit grayscale image. step shadow coin grayscale image removed. coins circular boundary. removing shadow hough transform circle detection used. first edge coin detected using sobel edge detection. following pseudo code hough transform step define -dimensional hough matrix height width grayscale image radii want search. edge pixel particular radius search circle center coordinates satisfy equation increase count hough matrix repeat step radii. fig. indian coins different denominations;
