{"title": "Unsupervised Text Extraction from G-Maps", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper represents an text extraction method from Google maps, GIS maps/images. Due to an unsupervised approach there is no requirement of any prior knowledge or training set about the textual and non-textual parts. Fuzzy CMeans clustering technique is used for image segmentation and Prewitt method is used to detect the edges. Connected component analysis and gridding technique enhance the correctness of the results. The proposed method reaches 98.5% accuracy level on the basis of experimental data sets.", "text": "abstractâ€”this paper represents text extraction method google maps maps/images. unsupervised approach requirement prior knowledge training textual non-textual parts. fuzzy cmeans clustering technique used image segmentation prewitt method used detect edges. connected component analysis gridding technique enhance correctness results. proposed method reaches accuracy level basis experimental data sets. text extraction technique take-out textual portion non-textual background e.g. images magazines articles books video snapshots maps news papers manuscripts advertisements banners street sign boards name plates cards pages etc. text extraction problem challenging widespread research areas computer vision complex backgrounds i.e. unknown regions mixture textual non-textual graphics. deal text extraction google maps essential geographical information systems know information particular geographic region written textual portions. unsupervised manner i.e. prior knowledge required. also fuzzy c-means clustering segmenting input g-maps prewitt method edge detection. connected component analysis gridding lead proposed method accurate. clustering process partition space regions basis similarities properties. clustering technique developed improved dunn bezdek respectively. clustering algorithm follows step remove attached non-textual parts imcc times texts written curvy thin smaller lines. gridding imcc partitioning block value either binarization. total column diagonal high possibility block fig. cleared able extract textual parts g-maps proposed method gives noise-free fine results. fig. unable utility grid structuring technique shown fig.. proposed hybrid model tested hundreds test samples achieve accuracy. connected component analysis possibilities non-textual portion touched textual ones. problem overcome grid structuring scrutiny. proposed method also works well topological maps historical maps maps etc. language independent maps. limitation proposed method fully automatic thresholding selection better result dependent human eye. next venture overcome limitation make system accurate. would like heartily thank prof. bidyut chaudhuri ieee fellow head computer vision pattern recognition unit indian statistical institute kolkata india discussion various aspects research field. lloyd alan fletcher rangachar kasturia robust algorithm text string separation ieee transactions pattern analysis machine intelligence vol. november wanzhen wang chengyi hongxing chao color image segmentation understanding connected components proc. icsmc isbn vol. pp.-oct otsu threshold selection method gray-level histograms ieee transactions systems cyberneticsvol. angadi kodabagi texture based methodology text region extraction resolution natural scene images international journal image processing volume issue wafa boussellaa aymen bougacha abderrazak zahour haikal abed adel alimi enhanced text extraction arabic degraded document images using algorithm international conference document analysis recognition isbn ---- july zhixin srirangaraj govindaraju text extraction gray scale historical document image using adaptive local connectivity proc. eighth international conference document analysis recognition vol. audithan chandrasekaran document text extraction document images using haar discrete wavelet transform european journal scientific research vol. pp.- davod zaravi habib rostami alireza malahzaheh mortazavi journals subheadlines text extraction using wavelet thresholding projection profile world academy science engineering technology issue miriam leon veronica vilaplana antoni gasull ferran marques caption text extraction indexing purposes using hierarchical region-based image model proc. ieee international conference image processing pp.- alves hashimoto text regions extracted scene images ultimate attribute opening decision tree classification proc. sibgrapi conference graphics patterns images isbn ---- sunil kumar rajat gupta nitin khanna santanu chaudhury shiv dutt joshi text extraction document image segmentation using matched wavelets model ieee transactions image processing vol. rama mohan babu srimaiyee a.srikrishna text extraction heterogeneous images using mathematical morphology journal theoretical applied information technologyvol. c.p. sumathi santhanam gayathri devi survey various approaches text extraction images international journal computer science engineering survey vol. august", "year": 2014}
