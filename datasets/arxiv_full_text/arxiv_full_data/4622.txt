{"title": "Design and Development of an Expert System to Help Head of University  Departments", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "One of the basic tasks which is responded for head of each university department, is employing lecturers based on some default factors such as experience, evidences, qualifies and etc. In this respect, to help the heads, some automatic systems have been proposed until now using machine learning methods, decision support systems (DSS) and etc. According to advantages and disadvantages of the previous methods, a full automatic system is designed in this paper using expert systems. The proposed system is included two main steps. In the first one, the human expert's knowledge is designed as decision trees. The second step is included an expert system which is evaluated using extracted rules of these decision trees. Also, to improve the quality of the proposed system, a majority voting algorithm is proposed as post processing step to choose the best lecturer which satisfied more expert's decision trees for each course. The results are shown that the designed system average accuracy is 78.88. Low computational complexity, simplicity to program and are some of other advantages of the proposed system.", "text": "f=<software f=<software software image processing f=<software according feature vectors extracted volunteer based default factors complex problem head computer department choose best them. problem many challenges head choose best follows dimension important?
