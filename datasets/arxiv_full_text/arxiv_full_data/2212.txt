{"title": "A Machine Learning Approach for Evaluating Creative Artifacts", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Much work has been done in understanding human creativity and defining measures to evaluate creativity. This is necessary mainly for the reason of having an objective and automatic way of quantifying creative artifacts. In this work, we propose a regression-based learning framework which takes into account quantitatively the essential criteria for creativity like novelty, influence, value and unexpectedness. As it is often the case with most creative domains, there is no clear ground truth available for creativity. Our proposed learning framework is applicable to all creative domains; yet we evaluate it on a dataset of movies created from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes due to availability of audience and critic scores, which can be used as proxy ground truth labels for creativity. We report promising results and observations from our experiments in the following ways : 1) Correlation of creative criteria with critic scores, 2) Improvement in movie rating prediction with inclusion of various creative criteria, and 3) Identification of creative movies.", "text": "abstract much work done understanding human creativity defining measures evaluate creativity. necessary

motivated following goals first modelling creative generation process enable machines generate creative content; second enabling machines augment human creativity third assessing identifying creativity without assumption artifact produced machines humans. understanding creativity entails following first quantitative evaluation creativity based different criteria second learning creative scoring models criteria. following idea formulate automated learning based approach evaluate creative artifacts. according recent literature essential criteria creativity mainly following value novelty influence unexpectedness. value artifact measure well perceived society isolation; without comparison artifacts domain. appealing useful pleasant performing artifact exact criterion heavily dependent upon domain users. example user rate movie ‘silence lambs’ high good acting direction whereas another user rate presence violent disturbing stills movie. novelty artifact notion different artifacts domain. example ‘honey butter pepper lemon chicken’ novel recipe nobody tried even though taste weird hence valuable. influence artifact quantifies much impactful inspiring towards artifacts occurring later time. example ‘mona lisa’ known inspiration raphael’s painting ‘young woman unicorn’ many others. another criteria unexpectedness surprise defines different artifact attributes expected behavior. example black-and-white movie like ‘the american astronaut’ year unexpected even though movies novel appeared past. convinced idea evaluation creative artifacts involve four criteria proceed build machine learning framework incorporating them; come objective automatic evaluating creativity applicable domains. approach first compute criteria-specific measures used features regression-based model. definitions clear criteria except value require comparison artifact others help similarity function. similarity function vary based domain. framework assumes availability similarity function define computation measures different creative criteria included regression model. hence approach applicable domains conditional availability similarity function corresponding domains. even though approach used evaluate creative artifacts domains choose perform experiments movies dataset availability ground truth ratings like critics score audience score. according audience ratings correlate weakly judgment professional movie critics. although movie ‘moonlight’ hailed critics received well audience. hand ‘interstellar’ slammed critics even though huge success. perhaps critics well-versed landscape movies hence give higher importance novelty influence audience. justify claim experiments showing measures criteria highly correlated critics score. prediction model inclusion various creative criteria lead improved performance predictions audience critics score. previous work tried combine multiple criteria evaluate artifacts using various heuristics. best knowledge first machine-learning approach uses ideas philosophies creativity come rating prediction model. proposed framework section going elaborate details learning based framework used evaluate creativity artifacts domain. consider artifacts {mi}m want rate based creativity. based information available artifact artifact rated here function takes information available artifact input produces rating here corresponds list attributes. examples attributes genre runtime budget plot case movies. fashion apparel attributes gender apparel type brand colour texture image apparel etc. function broken feature extraction step followed prediction step follows function involves extraction different kinds features like value features novelty features influence features unexpectedness features thus given datapoints form yi}m function used transform training data yi}m regression model takes input feature artifact produce creativity rating value previous works like highlighted value important criteria creativity. value defined measure artifact valued domain experts class artifact reflection acceptance artifact society. example movie directed ‘christopher nolan’ perceived highly valuable compared lesser known director. fact elucidated well domain fashion certain colour combinations apparels valued higher based synergy list consisting prevalent colours. every artifact attributes could various types like numerical categorical textual even different modality like image etc. numerical attributes need encoding values used whereas categorical attributes need one-hot encoding textual modalities require embedding-based representations. application encoding schemes dimensionality reduction technique like principal components analysis applied produce list vectors list vectors treated input vector regression model predict output rating equation above learning model tries assign higher weights dimensions highly correlated output rating. model consider datapoint highly valuable combination correlated dimensions leads better rating prediction. formulation value aspect creativity inherently captured regression-based model features every datapoint extracted isolation without considering datapoints. novelty influence framework propose include important metrics computed similarity graph obtained data points novelty influence. according novelty measure different artifact known artifacts class. words artifact apart known artifacts considered highly novel. example first ever time time-travel movie high novelty score compared time-travel movies came much later. similarly artifacts completely different known artifacts hence novel missing value aspect. hand influence measures artifact inspiration impact another artifact. example ‘the godfather’ movie significant influence sequel. similarly first time-travel movie would significant influence similar movies appearing later time. domain fashion designers tend inspired works designers means previous works influence later ones. also however possible non-novel artifacts also influence later works. evident definitions novelty influence measures artifact cannot computed isolation artifacts require similarity artifacts. noted even though design appearing later time directly inspired earlier eyes undirected graph. next steps equations select edges graph forward time also direction influence thus producing directed graph. followed thresholding step equation mandates high value edges eligible score propagation. step leads addition negative weighted edges graph corrected edge reversal step equation resulting creation edges going forward time. however preserve distinction edges reversed others graph split directed graphs prior graph subsequent graph remaining steps. elaborated former graph leads computation novelty scores whereas latter leads generation influence scores. equations along column normalization step produces column-stochastic matrices every attibute matrices together help computing novelty scores influence scores aggregate scores based following equations power iteration method used solve equation substituting back solution equation novelty scores artifacts attribute equation computation attributes results instance specific scores artifact vectors dimension number attributes. unexpectedness unexpectedness also known surprise defined criteria creativity measures artifact different expected attributes amount difference important typically evaluation unexpectedness considers recent past figure artifact attributes unexpected. example black-and-white movie unexpected colour movies norm. however french movie ‘the artist’ would considered highly unexpected colour movies. another curious example wide-rimmed glasses pretty much fashion till brief period went fashion. artifact appeared early would highly unexpected compared current years back fashion again. fine difference novelty unexpectedness novelty implies unexpectedness round. unexpectedness defined different boden’s notion p-creativity notion considers artifact unexpected certain time rather unexpected creator. observer earlier influential high similarity. considering observer/critic point view measures highly related chronological order artifacts earlier artifacts tend influence later ones. works like already mentioned using chronological order movies measuring influence based movie citation network includes explicit references movies. explicit references lead sparse connections incomplete information manually curated imdb. hence suggest using similarity based graph artifacts used identifying milestone papers quantifying creative paintings pagerank calculating importance documents. first step towards construction similarity graph based analysis computation similarity matrices between pairs artifacts corresponding attribute attributes. type attribute dictates choice similarity measure follows every artifact also comes time occurrence based selection matrix computed. main idea graph among artifacts edges related similarity nodes novelty influence scores artifacts computed using pagerank algorithm. follows logic high similarity edge nodes source node influential novel target hence creative. complete sequence steps details) followed computing parameters graph listed below ’movie_release_date’ ‘movie_writer_name’ etc. dropped either conveyed useful information information conveyed expressed attribute e.g. director_facebook_likes useful name director analysis. also dropped attributes like box-office collection movie number audience/critics rated movie number facebook likes movie etc. heavily correlated rating movie. following attributes used output labels predicted models computation measures criteria requires time artifact created. removed movies release year missing. either imdb year release year release movie present kept movie entry. entries present take imdb year. none present discard movie. elimination left movies proceed further. attribute representation. curation dataset finally unique attributes table also report number missing values attribute. reason missing values either present original kaggle-dataset inconsistencies matching movies imdb web-scraping movies website. filled mean corresponding attributes ‘na’ missing numeric string attribute values respectively. next needed convert categorical attributes numerical values used analysis. attributes consisted single string semantic meaning associated used wordvec vectors dimension each. attributes consisted sentences converted skip-thought vectors dimension each average pooling across sentences. attribute values wordvec skip-thought representationwe took zero vector corresponding size. vectors attributes multiple strings multiple sentences obtained taking mean vector across strings/ sentences represent attribute. attributes color rt_studio converted one-hot encoded vectors. reduce large dimensionality feature space
