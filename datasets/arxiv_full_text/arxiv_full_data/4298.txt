{"title": "Toward Parts-Based Scene Understanding with Pixel-Support Parts-Sparse  Pictorial Structures", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Scene understanding remains a significant challenge in the computer vision community. The visual psychophysics literature has demonstrated the importance of interdependence among parts of the scene. Yet, the majority of methods in computer vision remain local. Pictorial structures have arisen as a fundamental parts-based model for some vision problems, such as articulated object detection. However, the form of classical pictorial structures limits their applicability for global problems, such as semantic pixel labeling. In this paper, we propose an extension of the pictorial structures approach, called pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures, or PS3, to overcome this limitation. Our model extends the classical form in two ways: first, it defines parts directly based on pixel-support rather than in a parametric form, and second, it specifies a space of plausible parts-based scene models and permits one to be used for inference on any given image. PS3 makes strides toward unifying object-level and pixel-level modeling of scene elements. In this report, we implement the first half of our model and rely upon external knowledge to provide an initial graph structure for a given image. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of this new parts-based view of scene modeling.", "text": "scene understanding remains signiﬁcant challenge computer vision community. visual psychophysics literature demonstrated importance interdependence among parts scene. majority methods computer vision remain local. pictorial structures arisen fundamental parts-based model vision problems articulated object detection. however form classical pictorial structures limits applicability global problems semantic pixel labeling. paper propose extension pictorial structures approach called pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures overcome limitation. model extends classical form ways ﬁrst deﬁnes parts directly based pixel-support rather parametric form second speciﬁes space plausible parts-based scene models permits used inference given image. makes strides toward unifying object-level pixel-level modeling scene elements. report implement ﬁrst half model rely upon external knowledge provide initial graph structure given image. experimental results benchmark datasets demonstrate capability parts-based view scene modeling. consider semantic pixel labeling problem given semantic classes tree etc. task associate label every pixel. although hotly studied recent years semantic labeling remains critical challenge broader image understanding community obvious reasons like high intraclass variability occlusion etc. early approaches relied texture clustering segmentation e.g. recently conditional random ﬁelds become facto representation problem e.g. methods learn strong classiﬁer based local patches superpixels specify form smoothness prior ﬁeld. although methods demonstrated good success challenging real world datasets performance remains limited reason intrinsically local making difﬁcult incorporate notion object even region semantics. visual psychophysics literature demonstrated clear importance modeling objectinter-object relational level full scene understanding although work overcoming challenge locality little work direction incorporating notion scene parts inter-relationship among parts. contrast present parts-based approach full semantic pixel labeling marries object-level model parts scene pixel-level representation rather strictly pixelregion-level model. method sits broad class pictorial structures shown notable success articulated object modeling recent years however classical pictorial structures well-suited semantic image labeling parameterize object parts abstract completely pixel-level require parts present scene typically adopt simple relational models three characteristics classical models make unsuitable image labeling problems. method called pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures overcomes limitations takes step towards parts-based view image understanding proposing joint global model image parts—objects scene trees cars road etc.— nodes pictorial structures graph. directly ties part pixels without restrictive parameterization affords rich object-level measurements e.g. global shape. also deﬁnes space plausible part-graphs learns complete relation models pairwise elements. inference suitable part-graph selected optimized jointly localizes parts object level performs semantic labeling pixel level. tested method msrc sift-flow benchmarks demonstrate better performance respect maximum likelihood markov random ﬁeld performance controlled experimental setting also compare methods existing semantic pixel labeling approaches limited signiﬁcant assumption given parts-graph test image. remainder paper present related papers describe classical pictorial structures extensions including appropriate inference algorithm experimental results conclusion future work. related papers several recent papers similarly demonstrated signiﬁcance moving beyond local methods. demonstrate value incorporating partial information scene detection. take hierarchical approach full scene understanding integrating patchlevel object-level textual tags generative model. examples hold strong promise scene understanding directly applicable labeling. promising method applicable labeling proposes relative location prior semantic class model conditional random ﬁeld superpixels image. whereas approach deﬁnes joint distribution superpixels image potentially remains local approach deﬁnes essentially layer superpixels affording global coverage capability also model shape semantic image part. another strategy share information among different sub-problems image understanding. cascaded classiﬁcation models approach shares information across object detection geometrical reasoning. yang drive pixel-labeling process bank parts-based object detectors;
