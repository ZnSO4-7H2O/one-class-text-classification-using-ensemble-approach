These properties are used to recognise an image or an object. Then this process could be taken as a model to develop computer algorithms for images identification. This paper proposes the idea of applying the simplified firefly algorithm to search for key-areas in 2D images. For a set of input test images the proposed version of firefly algorithm has been examined. Research results are presented and discussed to show the efficiency of this evolutionary computation method.", "text": "year={} isbn={----} booktitle={ ieee symposium computational intelligence
