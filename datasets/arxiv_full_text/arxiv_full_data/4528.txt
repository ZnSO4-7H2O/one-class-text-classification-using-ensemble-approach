{"title": "Discovering general partial orders in event streams", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Frequent episode discovery is a popular framework for pattern discovery in event streams. An episode is a partially ordered set of nodes with each node associated with an event type. Efficient (and separate) algorithms exist for episode discovery when the associated partial order is total (serial episode) and trivial (parallel episode). In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for discovering frequent episodes with general partial orders. These algorithms can be easily specialized to discover serial or parallel episodes. Also, the algorithms are flexible enough to be specialized for mining in the space of certain interesting subclasses of partial orders. We point out that there is an inherent combinatorial explosion in frequent partial order mining and most importantly, frequency alone is not a sufficient measure of interestingness. We propose a new interestingness measure for general partial order episodes and a discovery method based on this measure, for filtering out uninteresting partial orders. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "text": "occurences said non-overlapped either occurences said non-overlapped every pair occurences non-overlapped. cardinality largest non-overlapped occurrences denotes event-types automaton already accepted denotes event-types automaton state ready accept. initially automaton state accepted events waiting start state time currently state suppose entries Î±.init list namely tim. represent corresponding sets accepted event-types active automata. consider similarly super-episode maximal subepisode belongs others category. example would belong others category. init column table table indicates number episodes", "year": 2009}
