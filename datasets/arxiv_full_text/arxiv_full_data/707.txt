{"title": "Smart Content Recognition from Images Using a Mixture of Convolutional  Neural Networks", "tag": ["stat.ML", "cs.CV", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "With rapid development of the Internet, web contents become huge. Most of the websites are publicly available, and anyone can access the contents from anywhere such as workplace, home and even schools. Nevertheless, not all the web contents are appropriate for all users, especially children. An example of these contents is pornography images which should be restricted to certain age group. Besides, these images are not safe for work (NSFW) in which employees should not be seen accessing such contents during work. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision problems. Inspired by these successes, we propose a mixture of convolutional neural networks for adult content recognition. Unlike other works, our method is formulated on a weighted sum of multiple deep neural network models. The weights of each CNN models are expressed as a linear regression problem learned using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both single CNN model and the average sum of CNN models in adult content recognition.", "text": "abstract. rapid development internet contents become huge. websites publicly available anyone access contents anywhere workplace home even schools. nevertheless contents appropriate users especially children. example contents pornography images restricted certain group. besides images safe work employees seen accessing contents work. recently convolutional neural networks successfully applied many computer vision problems. inspired successes propose mixture convolutional neural networks adult content recognition. unlike works method formulated weighted multiple deep neural network models. weights models expressed linear regression problem learned using ordinary least squares experimental results demonstrate proposed model outperforms single model average models adult content recognition. number internet users increases rapidly since introduction world wide growth internet users content internet becomes huge. however contents adult content appropriate users. filtering websites restricting access adult images significant problems researchers trying solve decades. different methods introduced block restrict access adult websites address blocking text filtering image filtering. internet protocol address blocking bans adult content accessed certain users. technique works maintaining list domain name servers addresses non-appropriate websites. request application agent compares requested website address restricted list. request denied addresses match approved otherwise. method requires manual keeping maintenance restricted list difficult number adult content websites grows websites change addresses regularly. filtering text popular method block access adult content websites. text filtering method blocks access website contains least restricted words. another approach machine learning algorithm find restricted words. sometimes instead using machine learning technique extract keywords classification model used directly decide whether requested webpage safe nonetheless text blocking method understands texts cannot work images. problem arises webpage contain restricted keywords contain text all. worse still block safe webpages medical webpage contains restricted keywords. another blocking method uses image filtering method works directly images trying detect image contains adult content. detection directly images favorable require list scalable websites sensitive certain keywords. however detecting adult content images requires complex model images different illuminations positions backgrounds resolutions poses. addition image contain part human body person image partially dressed. paper seek automatically recognize adult content images using mixture convolutional neural networks fig. shows architecture proposed model eight cnns models followed fully connected layers used vote possible class image. model conforms architecture different weights computed using ordinary least square usually training time deep long. present solution create eight models single architecture training. checkpoint identify pick eight most-performing models training session. solution selects optimal model improve accuracy helps reduce training time drastically. contributions paper follows constructing mixture multiple deep cnns extra cost;
