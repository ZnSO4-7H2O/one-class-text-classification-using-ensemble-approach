{"title": "Rough Clustering Based Unsupervised Image Change Detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "This paper introduces an unsupervised technique to detect the changed region of multitemporal images on a same reference plane with the help of rough clustering. The proposed technique is a soft-computing approach, based on the concept of rough set with rough clustering and Pawlak's accuracy. It is less noisy and avoids pre-deterministic knowledge about the distribution of the changed and unchanged regions. To show the effectiveness, the proposed technique is compared with some other approaches.", "text": "abstract—this paper introduces unsupervised technique detect changed region multitemporal images reference plane help rough clustering. proposed technique soft-computing approach based concept rough rough clustering pawlak’s accuracy. less noisy avoids pre-deterministic knowledge distribution changed unchanged regions. show effectiveness proposed technique compared approaches. change detection technique identify analyze differences images/objects reference plane different times. utilized remote sensing underwater sensing weapon detection video surveillance medical diagnosis treatment civil mechanical infrastructure driver assistance systems vegetation changes shifting cultivations monitoring etc. change detection approaches supervised unsupervised maximum cases unsupervised techniques appropriate supervised ones unavailability platform truth information. change detection observed clustering process i.e. classification data sets changed unchanged. patterns ‘within cluster’ ‘between clusters’ homogeneous heterogeneous respectively rough clustering used rough lower approximation represents unchanged clusters upper approximation represents changed clusters. pawlak’s accuracy used generate difference image. proposed method compared hard c-means fuzzy c-means methods reported rough theory assumption granted i.e. information related every entry data matrix. over-all information expresses completely available object-knowledge. precisely information system pair tuples non-empty finite object called universe a={a…aj} nonmain thing rough equivalence objects equivalence relation formed knowledge-based objects information system. partitions build subsets. information system rough clustering expansion rough sets containing extra requirements ordered attribute value distance measurement like standard clustering techniques distance measurement done ordering value clusters generated distance measure. fig.. satellite image saudi arabia geographical region acquired acquired changed region detected proposed rough clustering based technique respectively. fig. fig.. hall monitoring qcif video reference frame frames different time intervals change detection reference frame change detection reference frame proposed rough clustering based technique proposed method tested different images produces stable noiseless fairly good results every case assesses high robustness technique. performance proposed technique compared algorithms works fine. limitation type change detection technique multitemporal images dependent static reference plane. next venture prescribed technique combine rough clustering different fuzzy clustering classifiers would like heartily thank prof. bidyut chaudhuri ieee fellow head computer vision pattern recognition unit indian statistical institute kolkata india discussion various aspects research field. hung purnawan b.c. multispectal image classification using rough theory particle swam optimization advances geoscience remote sensing intech isbn ---- pp.- october tung-chien chen video segmentation based image change detection surveillance systems final project image processing reconstruction online available http//classes.soe.ucsc.edu/ee/spring/chenreport.pdf jun’. bracamonte ansorge pellandini farine complexity change detection algorithm operating compressed domain proc. cost workshop information knowledge management integrated media communication sensed data int. remote sens. vol. collins woodcock assessment several linear change detection techniques mapping forest mortality using multitemporal landsat data remote sens. environ. vol. subsol delingette ayache automatic detection segmentation evolving processes medical images application multiple sclerosis med. image anal. vol. jun. chavez mackinnon automatic detection vegetation changes southwestern united states using remotely sensed images photogram eng. remote sensing vol. pp.-", "year": 2014}
