{"title": "What the Language You Tweet Says About Your Occupation", "tag": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Many aspects of people's lives are proven to be deeply connected to their jobs. In this paper, we first investigate the distinct characteristics of major occupation categories based on tweets. From multiple social media platforms, we gather several types of user information. From users' LinkedIn webpages, we learn their proficiencies. To overcome the ambiguity of self-reported information, a soft clustering approach is applied to extract occupations from crowd-sourced data. Eight job categories are extracted, including Marketing, Administrator, Start-up, Editor, Software Engineer, Public Relation, Office Clerk, and Designer. Meanwhile, users' posts on Twitter provide cues for understanding their linguistic styles, interests, and personalities. Our results suggest that people of different jobs have unique tendencies in certain language styles and interests. Our results also clearly reveal distinctive levels in terms of Big Five Traits for different jobs. Finally, a classifier is built to predict job types based on the features extracted from tweets. A high accuracy indicates a strong discrimination power of language features for job prediction task.", "text": "uncover connections jobs characteristics people hold jobs procedure involves several steps. first need separate people based jobs. categorizing people types particularly challenging jobs less specialized instead might share common responsibilities duties. therefore step rely skills people determine categories less likely belong soft clustering method used assign normalized weight type person based skills. next step also need learn person’s characteristics linguistic patterns interests personality traits achieving steps allow compute pearson correlation coefﬁcients between people’s characteristics weights different types. achieve steps need ﬁrst ﬁgure people’s skills learn characteristics. social media posts proven effective information source gaining knowledge people individuals tend social media sites platforms self-presentation therefore extract rich information people’s characteristics share online. select twitter data support study twitter widely effectively used user proﬁling relatively easy collect. linguistic features apply closed vocabulary open vocabulary approaches described ones’ tweets. closed vocabulary approach uses ﬁxed lexicon analyse text open vocabulary approach limit vocabulary. former apply linguistic inquiry word count extract linguistic features tweets. latter types linguistic features learned representative words phrases topics. tweets also provide rich information personalities apply watson personality insights service compute personality traits tweets. personality measured five traits widely examined theory broad dimensions describing human personality dimensions openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism. many aspects people’s lives proven deeply connected jobs. paper ﬁrst investigate distinct characteristics major occupation categories based tweets. multiple social media platforms gather several types user information. users’ linkedin webpages learn proﬁciencies. overcome ambiguity self-reported information soft clustering approach applied extract occupations crowd-sourced data. eight categories extracted including marketing administrator start-up editor software engineer public relation ofﬁce clerk designer. meanwhile users’ posts twitter provide cues understanding linguistic styles interests personalities. results suggest people different jobs unique tendencies certain language styles interests. results also clearly reveal distinctive levels terms five traits different jobs. finally classiﬁer built predict types based features extracted tweets. high accuracy indicates strong discrimination power language features prediction task. recent statistics published linkedin revealed increasing number employers relies personality assessments screen prospective employees appears certain jobs likely attract better certain people. hiring practice commonly used organizations research directly looks connections different positions people positions. indeed many studies sociology psychology suggest many aspects person’s lives deeply connected jobs study looked connections different positions characteristics people hold positions including language topics interested personalty traits. ﬁndings suggested jobs copyright association

skill list also displayed user’s linkedin page. listed skills endorsed users knows person. skill list associated number votes skill receives. although learn linkedin users’ industries proﬁles self-reported information usually imprecise ambiguous. example manually check proﬁles professors department. report industry computer science others higher education research. come precise accurate categories apply soft clustering method people’s skills endorsed others group skills describe job. three beneﬁts this skill concept ﬁner granularity industry. skills person voted people know person. crowdsourced data accurate information provided person him/herself. given complex nature today’s jobs makes sense restrict person occupation. instead individual perform several responsibilities possess several skills might possibly qualify multiple categories. example product manger company could described programmer manager. match linkedin twitter accounts people collect users about.me. integration platform allows users link multiple online identities twitter linkedin facebook proﬁle. randomly sample about.me users retain valid users register twitter linkedin accounts. interesting signiﬁcant differences uncovered among people different jobs study. open vocabulary approach provides dimensions implying traits jobs. example ofﬁce clerks talk daily life people jobs. according results people different jobs clearly different interests. people public relation writers show strong interests politics social events. divergences personalities also found. example managers extroverted software engineers least. base observations build classiﬁer predict jobs using features extracted tweets. high accuracy indicates adequate personal trait information hidden social media
