{"title": "Towards a Self-Organized Agent-Based Simulation Model for Exploration of  Human Synaptic Connections", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "nlin.AO"], "abstract": "In this paper, the early design of our self-organized agent-based simulation model for exploration of synaptic connections that faithfully generates what is observed in natural situation is given. While we take inspiration from neuroscience, our intent is not to create a veridical model of processes in neurodevelopmental biology, nor to represent a real biological system. Instead, our goal is to design a simulation model that learns acting in the same way of human nervous system by using findings on human subjects using reflex methodologies in order to estimate unknown connections.", "text": "onder g¨urcan university computer engineering department izmir turkey paul sabatier university irit institut recherche informatique toulouse france paper early design

nervous system composed excitable cells neurons muscles. typical neuron divided three functionally distinct parts dendrites soma axon. dendrites collect synaptic potentials neurons transmits soma. soma performs important non-linear processing step total synaptic potential exceeds certain threshold spike generated spike transmitted another neurons synapses. synapses occur axon terminal neuron dendrite soma second neuron axon terminal second axon terminal spike transmitted presynaptic neuron reaches synapse post-synaptic potential occurs postsynaptic neuron. either excite inhibit
