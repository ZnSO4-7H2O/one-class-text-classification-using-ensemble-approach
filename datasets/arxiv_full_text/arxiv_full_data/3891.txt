{"title": "Specifying nonspecific evidence", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE", "I.2.3; I.5.3"], "abstract": "In an earlier article [J. Schubert, On nonspecific evidence, Int. J. Intell. Syst. 8(6), 711-725 (1993)] we established within Dempster-Shafer theory a criterion function called the metaconflict function. With this criterion we can partition into subsets a set of several pieces of evidence with propositions that are weakly specified in the sense that it may be uncertain to which event a proposition is referring. Each subset in the partitioning is representing a separate event. The metaconflict function was derived as the plausibility that the partitioning is correct when viewing the conflict in Dempster's rule within each subset as a newly constructed piece of metalevel evidence with a proposition giving support against the entire partitioning. In this article we extend the results of the previous article. We will not only find the most plausible subset for each piece of evidence as was done in the earlier article. In addition we will specify each piece of nonspecific evidence, in the sense that we find to which events the proposition might be referring, by finding the plausibility for every subset that this piece of evidence belong to the subset. In doing this we will automatically receive indication that some evidence might be false. We will then develop a new methodology to exploit these newly specified pieces of evidence in a subsequent reasoning process. This will include methods to discount evidence based on their degree of falsity and on their degree of credibility due to a partial specification of affiliation, as well as a refined method to infer the event of each subset.", "text": "johan schubert division information system technology department command control warfare technology national defence research establishment stockholm sweden

originate several different unconnected sensor systems. reports carry proposition occurrence submarine specified time place probability truthfulness report contain additional information velocity direction type submarine. separate intelligence reports subsets according submarine referring intelligence reports never labeled submarine referring thus possible directly differentiate different

cause conflict nonfiring sensors placed positions reports required velocity travel positions reports respective times relation assumed velocity submarines etc. idea this. receive several pieces evidence several different separate events pieces evidence mixed want sort pieces evidence according event referring thus partition pieces evidence subsets subset refers particular event. figure subsets denoted here pieces evidence partitioned four subsets. number subsets uncertain also domain conflict conflict current number subsets domain knowledge. partition simply allocation pieces evidence different events. since events anything other analyze separately. uncertain event pieces evidence referring problem. could impossible know directly different pieces evidence referring event. know subset not. problem problem organization. evidence different problems want analyze unfortunately mixed problem separating solve problem conflict dempster’s rule pieces evidence within subset combined indication whether pieces evidence belong together. higher conflict less credible belong together. create additional piece evidence subset proposition additional piece evidence states adequate partition. proposition take value equal conflict combination within subset. pieces evidence regarding subset reason partition original evidence. confuse original evidence call evidence metalevel evidence combination analysis combination take place metalevel combination pieces metalevel evidence regarding subset receive support stating adequate partition. call support metaconflict. smaller support credible partition. thus credible partition minimizes metaconflict. know possible separate pieces evidence based proposition. instead prefer separate based conflicts. since conflict

using conflict dempster’s rule distance measure pieces evidence first suggested lowrance garvey. earlier article established within framework dempstershafer theory- criterion function overall conflict called metaconflict function. criterion partition evidence weakly specified propositions subsets subset representing separate event. events handled independently. make separation evidence possible every proposition’s action part must supplemented event part describing event proposition referring. proposition written conjunction literals disjunctions literal disjunction concerns event proposition referring event part. remainder proposition called action part. example earlier article illustrates terminology consider burglaries bakers’ shops baker street event event i.e. number events known two. witness hands piece evidence specific respect event proposition burglar baker street event part probably brown haired action part second anonymous witness hands nonspecific piece evidence proposition burglar baker street event part might haired action part example conflict pieces evidence subset different situations. first conflict proposition action parts conflicting regardless proposition event parts since presumed referring event. secondly proposition event parts conflicting then regardless proposition action parts conflict presumption referring event. metaconflict used partition evidence derived plausibility partitioning correct conflict subset viewed piece metalevel evidence partitioning evidence simple frame discernment metalevel short adequate

section section study usefulness specified evidence. obviously piece evidence belong several different subsets useful allowed strongly influence subsequent reasoning process within subset. describe improved method finding event represented subset finally illustrate methodology example bakers’ shops burglaries make comparison refined methodology advocated article simpler approach earlier article conflict subset interpreted piece metalevel evidence least piece evidence belong subset. thus refine basic probability assignment subset assigning support proposition partitioning least piece stating evidence belong equal matter whether base belief original piece metalevel evidence taken combination pieces metalevel evidence taken evidence entire partitioning less specific piece evidence cluster conflict. interpret domain conflict evidence exists least piece evidence belong first subsets particular piece evidence placed subset itself evidence belongs subsets. would indicate number subsets incorrect. study changes domain conflict take piece evidence subset piece evidence taken another already existing subset also subset itself assuming ...c change domain conflict subsets i.e. since current partition minimizes metaconflict function know number subsets increase increase total conflict theorem says decrease nondomain part metaconflict function. thus know must increase domain conflict. increase domain conflict indication belong additional subset another receive piece evidence domain conflict moved moved another already existing subset either increase decrease domain conflict. total conflict nondomain part function increases. thus different situations. domain conflict decreases move interpreted evidence belongs receive increase domain conflict interpret evidence belong take previous case without moving already existing subset remaining subsets since equal increase domain conflict. increase domain conflict interpreted specify original piece evidence combining evidence conflict variations regarding particular piece evidence. calculate belief plausibility subset particular piece evidence belongs subset. belief belongs subset zero except since every proposition regarding piece evidence states belong subset. combining pieces evidence regarding original piece evidence receive support proposition stating piece evidence belong subsets cannot subset itself. since impossible statement false support conflict dempster’s rule. statement piece evidence belong anyimplies false. thus interpret conflict support piece evidence false. received increase domain conflict moved introduced type evidence supporting belongs since piece evidence indicating belong never support impossible statement belong anywhere. thus always zero conflict combining pieces evidence. piece evidence belong subsets. since impossible statement implies degree false piece evidence. piece evidence known false would disregard completely indication possible falsity would take additional action. would like less less regard piece evidence higher degree false attention certainly false leave unchanged indication falsity. done using discounting operation introduced lowrance discounting operation introduced handle case source piece evidence lacking credibility. credibility source also became credibility piece evidence. situation handled discounting supported proposition credibility discounting operation case direct indication separate piece evidence regardless source produced view support false statement piece evidence belong subset cannot subset itself dempster’s rule combining pieces evidence regarding identical minus credibility evidence; credibility used discount piece evidence depends piece evidence itself. problem since credibility originates piece evidence higher level depends never combined instead used discount obviously discounting directed towards individual pieces evidence pieces evidence particular source depend piece evidence itself. note must repartition pieces evidence first discounting order receive credibilities perform second discounting. pieces evidence credibilities originating would independent. thus making second discounting piece evidence would violate independence assumption dempster’s rule since double discounting corresponds combining nonindependent pieces evidence concerning falsity discounting credibility derived combination; credibilities first second discounting credibility derived combination corresponding pieces evidence degrees falsity first second partitioning degree falsity combination pieces evidence. fact never repartition evidence discounting regardless whether plan perform second discounting not. discounting operation puts evidence order continuing reasoning processes regarding different events also smooths conflicting differences different pieces evidence basis conflict minimizing process pieces evidence partitioned subsets. since discounting smooths differences pieces evidence belong event repartitioning would increase risk pieces evidence referring different events would partitioned subset. thus never repartition pieces evidence discounting evidence falsity. obviously next question specified discounted piece evidence subsequent reasoning process concerning particular event? piece evidence belong subset also usable subsequent reasoning process subset. whether case determined specified event part. piece evidence useful reasoning process well another question. depends action part piece evidence. piece evidence belong subset clearly uncertain belongs subset question indeed possible all. must find measure uncertainty credibility belongs subset. using piece evidence reasoning process concerning subset would like calculate credibility belongs subset question discount credibility. obviously piece evidence cannot possibly belong subset discounted entirely subsequent reasoning process subset piece evidence cannot possibly belong subset without support whatsoever discounted used reasoning process thus degree piece evidence belong subset subset corresponds importance allowed play subset. order find credibility piece evidence reasoning process subset must measure uncertainty newly specified event part. measures uncertainty single piece evidence usually measures entropy. especially useful kind measure measure average total uncertainty. measure entropy measures scattering nonspecificity evidence basic probability assignment resulting fusion derived pieces evidence regarding subset belong would give indication usable piece evidence total towards subsets. want high plausibility likely subset i.e. little support piece evidence belongs subset. equivalent preferring minimal entropy remainder support scattered among focal elements little concern actually express preference regarding remainder support would choose uniform scattering among focal elements i.e. preferring possible plausibility second likely subset. equivalent preferring minimal entropy. comes specificity support different subsets prefer support specific concerns subsets preferably gives subsets plausibility nonspecificity concerns preferable subset giving plausibility high possible. thus overall preference consistent minimal entropy. plausibility belongs subset zero discount plausibility subset plausibility subsets plausibility subset plausibility different subsets plausibility credibility used subset greater equal belief making here however merely technical necessity order able evidence users force absolute specificity upon event part piece evidence placing subsets. discounting piece evidence credibility particular subset reasoning process could begin. note piece evidence could used several different subsets appropriate discounting i.e. particular subset every piece evidence belongs subset plausibility zero could used reasoning process within subset. also piece evidence whose original event part indicated possible event plausibility subsets come surprise since piece evidence might completely certain i.e. leaving mass supports event piece evidence completely certain regarding event referring giving credibility also even whose meaning determined pieces completely certain evidence contains might certain representing begin subsequent reasoning process subset naturally vital importance know event subset referring. information obtainable pieces evidence subset combined. combination focal element final addition supporting proposition regarding action also referring events proposed action taken place. could simply support favor event calculate plausibility form opinion regarding event subset referring based result. however cause problem. would certainly possible subset event likely event. situation avoided bring problem metalevel simultaneously reason subsets i.e. subsets referring events. analysis domain knowledge stating subset referring event. subset piece evidence indicating events might referring piece evidence directly derivable final resulting combination pieces evidence subset. simply remove information action focal element final leaving information event unchanged. leave focal elements supporting event disjunction events. support focal elements summed focal elements represented once. receive piece evidence metalevel originating subset paying attention actions paying attention events final resulting combination pieces evidence within subset. thus following piece evidence originating combining bpa’s different subsets restriction intersection combination yielding false eliminates possible problem event simultaneously assigned different subsets. method much higher chance give clearly preferable answer regarding event represented subsets viewing pieces evidence within subset trying determine event. return problem possible burglaries described first article. reexamine problem view results sections finally make comparison overconfident approach partitioning pieces evidence minimizing metaconflict function begin reasoning process separately subset refined approach discounting falsity uncertainty affiliation proposed article. example evidence weakly specified sense uncertain possible burglary propositions referring. specify pieces evidence studying cluster conflict variations piece evidence moved subset another subset subset itself. problem facing described follows assume baker’s shop baker street burglarized event also indication baker’s shop across street baker street might burglarized although burglary reported event experienced investigator estimates burglary taken place baker street probability received following pieces evidence. credible witness reports brownhaired employee baker’s shop committed burglary baker street evidence anonymous witness aware might burglaries reported brown-haired works baker’s shop committed burglary baker street evidence thirdly witness reports seen suspicious-looking red-haired baker’s shop baker street evidence finally fourth witness witness also anonymous aware possibility burglaries reporting burglar baker street baker’s shop brown-haired man. example pieces evidence originally subset minimizing metaconflict function found best partition pieces evidence subsets. minimum metaconflict function found evidence four moved evidence three remained event parts pieces evidence able conclude corresponded event corresponded event study cluster conflict variations. conflict domain conflict moved conflict drop zero moved conflict increases subset itself domain conflict thus seems pretty certain belongs three pieces evidence uncertain subset belong i.e. referring especially nonspecific event specific. could almost belong either subset. combined pieces evidence regarding particular piece evidence might belong received conflict thus indication might false. second third evidence conflict respectively. finally start reasoning process discount pieces evidence. time make individual discounting subset piece evidence according credible piece evidence belongs subset. credibility belongs burglar brown-haired although certainly plausible although less likely actually red-haired. even slighter indication might inside also possible burglar outsider. general evidence regarding event pretty inconclusive. however picture much clearer i.e. event quite likely burglar event brown-haired outsider. partitioned four pieces evidence ended ended partitioning minimized metaconflict thus probable partition. however said nothing probability piece evidence belong subset placed nothing much probable subset subsets. said probable subset all. thus piece evidence might subset marginally better falsely indicate certainty subsequent reasoning process within subset really exist. false certainty restriction degree using pieces evidence ended subsets partitioning. contrast refined approach uses pieces evidence could possibly belong subset reasoning process subset although discounted credibility belong subset. approach eliminates problem false certainty imposed partitioning seen following comparison approaches applied bakers’ shops burglary problem. comparison approaches much conclusions drawn whatever concluded earlier also concluded refined approach. burglar brown-haired outsider. real difference seems somewhat higher plausibility unlikely red-haired insider alternatives together lower support preferred brown-haired outsider alternatives mainly possibility placed partitioning might belong subset. before situation clear general find evidential intervals opened refined approach. discounting evidence. refined approach especially large drop support alternatives supported pieces evidence belong overconfident approach brown-haired insider red-haired also large increase plausibility alternatives supported pieces evidence belong brown-haired brown-haired outsider. possibility pieces evidence belong overconfident approach actually possibility belonging instead vice versa. consider three alternatives brown-haired insider brown-haired insider support plausibility respectively overconfident approach. refined approach small drop support brown-haired much larger drop insider brown-haired insider. possibility supporting brownhaired outsider belongs might plausible case would large impact since strongly supportive brownoverconfident approach might falsely haired outsider. thus concluded burglar brown-haired insider actually shown refined approach much open question whether probably brown-haired burglar insider not. article extended methodology partition nonspecific evidence developed previous article methodology specifying nonspecific evidence. clearly important extension analysis considering piece evidence subsequent reasoning process handled similarly different subsets approximately equally plausible whereas plausible subset would take piece evidence certainly belonging subset subsets would never consider reasoning processes. addition facts facilitate reasoning process. first specification process extended methodology besides specifying pieces evidence also give degree falsity degree credibility affiliation piece evidence. secondly methodology iteratively receive pieces evidence piece piece. together facts indicate possible develop methods disregarding immediately upon receipt false pieces evidence well methods focusing attention upon useful pieces evidence based maximum degree credibility. work described article extended find posterior probability distribution regarding number subsets used idea piece evidence subset supports existence subset degree piece evidence supports anything all. derive concerned question many subsets have. combined given prior domain probability distribution order obtain sought-after posterior domain distribution. conflict subset interpreted piece metalevel evidence least piece evidence belong subset. thus refine basic probability assignment subset assigning support proposition partitioning least piece stating evidence belong equal matter whether base belief original piece metalevel evidence taken combination pieces metalevel evidence taken thus also metalevel evidence regarding every subset increase conflict brought interpreted exists metalevel evidence indicating belong {eq} i.e. evidence entire partitioning less

would indicate number subsets incorrect. piece evidence subset piece evidence taken another already existing subset also subset itself assuming subsets i.e. change domain conflict since current partition minimizes metaconflict function know number subsets increase increase total conflict theorem says decrease nondomain part metaconflict function. thus know must increase domain conflict. increase domain conflict indication belong additional subset another receive piece evidence domain conflict moved moved another already existing subset either increase decrease domain conflict. total conflict nondomain part metaconflict function increases. thus different situations case. domain conflict decreases move choose adopt metarepresentation consisting three individual representations

increases number subsets increase decreases number subsets decrease. third representation behaves opposite way. three representations correspond three different situations number subsets changed. first representation corresponds situation piece evidence belongs subset increases domain conflict number subsets. second representation accordance situation third even consistent situation. second

corresponds last situation piece evidence belongs subset subsets receive increase domain conflict. situation first second representations consistent. without moved temporarily disregarded analysis
