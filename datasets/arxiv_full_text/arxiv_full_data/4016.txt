{"title": "Mouse Simulation Using Two Coloured Tapes", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) where, we control cursor movement using a real-time camera. Current methods involve changing mouse parts such as adding more buttons or changing the position of the tracking ball. Instead, our method is to use a camera and computer vision technology, such as image segmentation and gesture recognition, to control mouse tasks (left and right clicking, double-clicking, and scrolling) and we show how it can perform everything as current mouse devices can. The software will be developed in JAVA language. Recognition and pose estimation in this system are user independent and robust as we will be using colour tapes on our finger to perform actions. The software can be used as an intuitive input interface to applications that require multi-dimensional control e.g. computer games etc.", "text": "paper present novel approach human computer

computer interactions develop intuitive natural interfaces. computing environments presently strongly tied availability high resolution pointing device single discrete dimensional cursor. modern graphical user interface current standard interface personal computers well-defined provides efficient interface user various applications computer. guis combined devices mice track pads extremely effective reducing richness variety human communication single point. hile utility devices today’s interfaces cannot denied many users find capability rather limited tasks using gestures. opportunities apply kinds sensors techniques enrich user experience users. example video cameras computer vision techniques used capture many details human shape movement. shape hand analyzed time manipulate onscreen object analogous hand’s manipulation paper desk. approach lead faster natural fluid style interaction certain tasks. ubiquitous computing devoted changing relationship humans computers interact towards allowing computers become invisible recede periphery people’s lives. project mouse simulation using coloured tapes attempt ubiquitous computing. here using colour tapes fingers. tapes used controlling cursor movement relative distance coloured tapes used click events mouse. thus system provide experience users interacting computer. research done fields human computer interaction robotics. researchers tried control mouse movement using video devices hci. however used different methods make mouse cursor movement clicking events. approach hojoon park used index finger cursor movement angle index finger thumb clicking events. also erdem used finger tracking control motion mouse. click mouse button implemented defining screen click occurred user’s hand passed region. another approach developed chu-feng lien used finger-tips control mouse cursor click. clicking method based image density required user hold mouse cursor desired spot short period time. paul used another method click. used motion thumb mark clicking event thumb. movement hand making special hand sign moved mouse pointer. malik developed real-time system track position orientation thumb index finger hand without special markers gloves. system could used single pointing pinching gestures. robotics asanterabi malima developed finger counting system control behaviour robot. study existing systems on-screen choice selection reveals people still limited devices mouse touchpad joystick trackball touch screen. devices need contact hand them. proposed approach touch-free. first step system separate potential hand pixels non-hand pixels. done background subtraction scheme segments potential foreground hand information non-changing background scene. system startup pair background images captured represent static workspace camera view. subsequent frames appropriate background image segment moving foreground data. fter background subtraction process skin segmentation done. here histogram-based skin classifier assigns pixels training either skin histogram non-skin histogram. given histograms probability computed given color belongs skin non-skin classes. skin segmentation process outputs image ready detection color tapes finger. algorithm based color space used effective select certain color image. idea convert pixels color plane less affected variations shades similar color. then tolerance mask used converted image saturation plane. resulting binary image convolution phase reduce noise introduced. using index finger yellow colour tape cursor controller control mouse cursor movement. different approaches moving mouse cursor used. first method position mapping index finger camera screen desktop screen position. method incurs problem. resolution desktop window greater camera resolution cursor position cannot accurate converting camera resolution desktop window resolution intermediate values lost. expected ratio jumping pixel pixels. second method known weighted speed cursor control. difference finger current image previous image found distance computed. next mouse cursor moves fast finger images close cursor moves slow. problem associated algorithm also. machines cannot achieve image processing work smoothly computing image center hand shape takes time. paper concerning first method uses absolute position finger tips accurate second method. click events mouse mapped different hand gestures. idea focuses processing distance coloured tapes fingers. click events detailed subsequent points. first step system records distance yellow tapes index finger thumb respectively. here index thumb must apart much possible maximum distance distance regarded threshold distance event. thumb moves towards index finger distance finger tips words distance yellow tapes decreases. second step thumb close index finger system records reduced distance distance tapes reduced less consider event left click event mouse cursor. right click event cursor simulated using concept waiting time. yellow tape index finger waiting seconds front camera pointing location event recognised right click event mouse cursor. here distance yellow tapes respectively. required hand gesture depicted figure double click event cursor also simulated right click event considering waiting time. difference finger gesture used double click shown figure colour tapes waiting time seconds distance colour tapes less event recognised double click event mouse cursor. system proposed colour tapes fingers functions done considering relative distance tapes waiting time. method greater efficiency methods used earlier regard bare finger tips used. finger detection algorithms much effective colour finger cannot differentiated colour hand. requires complex algorithms. avoid complex algorithms make system quick enough real time computation proposed colour tapes finger tips. completely distinguishes finger rest part hand. distinction makes colour detection algorithm detect quite easily cursor movement. thus complexity computation reduced overall results improved. system proposed completely revolutionize people would computer system. presently
