By utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network, which is originally designed for image classification, we are able to separate content and style of different images and recombine them into a single image. We then propose a method that can add colors to a grayscale image by combining its content with style of a color image having semantic similarity with the grayscale one. As an application, to our knowledge the first of its kind, we use the proposed method to colorize images of ukiyo-e a genre of Japanese painting?and obtain interesting results, showing the potential of this method in the growing field of computer assisted art.", "text": "グエン・トゥン/立命館大学大学院 情報理工学研究科 森和貴ターウォンマット・ラック/立命館大学 情報理工学部 tung nguyen/graduate school information science engineering ritsumeikan university kazuki mori ruck thawonmas/college information science engineering ritsumeikan university *issk ed.ritsumei.ac.jp *iskhed.ritsumei.ac.jp *ruckis.ritsumei.ac.jp paper present novel approach uses deep learning techniques colorizing grayscale images. utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural network originally designed image classification able separate content style different images recombine single image. propose method colors grayscale image combining content style color image semantic similarity grayscale one. application knowledge first kind proposed method colorize images ukiyo-e—a genre japanese painting—and obtain interesting results showing potential method growing field computerassisted art. image colorization process assigning colors grayscale image make aesthetically appealing perceptually meaningful. known sophisticated task often requires prior knowledge image content manual adjustments order achieve artefactfree quality. furthermore since objects different colors many possible ways assign colors pixels image means unique solution problem. main approaches image colorization requires user assign colors regions extends information whole image another tries learn color pixel color image similar content. paper latter approach; extract information color image transfer another image. recently deep learning gained increasing attention among researchers field computer vision image processing. typical technique convolutional neural networks well-studied successfully applied several tasks image recognition image reconstruction image generation etc. consists multiple layers small computational units process portions input image feed-forward fashion. layer result applying various image filters extracts certain feature input image previous layer. thus layer contain useful information input image different levels abstraction. evolution computational resources especially computing power gpus become possible train deep cnns achieved remarkable results recently. example deep surpassed human-level performance imagenet classification adversarial network cnns trained simultaneously capable generating plausible-looking images many kinds objects. gatys presented application deep neural networks could learn transfer style image another one. given image content preserved another image style transferred passed images pre-trained extracted content representation style representation respectively. noisy image made changes obtained similar representations content image style image. indeed optimization problem objective minimize loss reconstructing content style simultaneously. mentioned paper used gradient descent solve problem. follow gatys al.’s approach work different optimization method since gradient descent normally requires much fine-tuning parameters work well specific problem. order improve optimization efficiency lbfgs—a quasi-newton method approximates broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm using limited amount computer memory—as figure images generated different optimization methods. fixed style weight. decreasing style weight. l-bfgs fixed style weight. l-bfgs decreasing style weight applied proposed method colorize images ukiyo-e genre japanese painting represents highpoints japanese cultural achievement. figure shows examples generated images obtained running iterations torch implementation also compared different optimization methods illustrated results fig. stochastic gradient descent fine-tuning parameters manually showed results generated best parameters could find. contrast l-bfgs required fine-tuning produced images look slightly better. optimization methods seen decreasing style weight iterations helped improve visual quality generated images. paper presented reliable method colorizing grayscale images uses extract color information image transfer another image. showed examples plausible-looking generated images. results indicate presented method used creativity tool assist human artists near future.", "year": 2016}
