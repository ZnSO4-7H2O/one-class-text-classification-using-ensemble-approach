{"title": "Detecting hip fractures with radiologist-level performance using deep  neural networks", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We developed an automated deep learning system to detect hip fractures from frontal pelvic x-rays, an important and common radiological task. Our system was trained on a decade of clinical x-rays (~53,000 studies) and can be applied to clinical data, automatically excluding inappropriate and technically unsatisfactory studies. We demonstrate diagnostic performance equivalent to a human radiologist and an area under the ROC curve of 0.994. Translated to clinical practice, such a system has the potential to increase the efficiency of diagnosis, reduce the need for expensive additional testing, expand access to expert level medical image interpretation, and improve overall patient outcomes.", "text": "developed automated deep learning system detect fractures frontal pelvic x-rays important common radiological task. system trained
