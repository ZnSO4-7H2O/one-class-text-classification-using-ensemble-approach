We use HMIs of multi-modal thermal conditioning systems in passenger cars as example for a complex setpoint selection system. The goal is the reduction of interaction complexity up to full automation. The approach is not limited to climate control applications but can be extended to other setpoint-based HMIs.", "text": "fig. data conventional climate control systems used current production
