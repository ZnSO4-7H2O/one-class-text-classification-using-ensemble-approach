{"title": "Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning  Algorithms", "tag": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "We present Fashion-MNIST, a new dataset comprising of 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits. The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist", "text": "present fashion-mnist dataset comprising grayscale images fashion products categories images training images test category. images. fashion-mnist intended serve direct dropreplacement original mnist dataset benchmarking machine learning algorithms shares image size data format structure training testing splits. freely available https//github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. mnist dataset comprising -class handwritten digits ﬁrst introduced lecun time could foreseen stellar rise deep learning techniques performance. despite fact today deep learning much simple mnist dataset become widely used testbed deep learning surpassing cifar imagenet popularity google trends. despite simplicity usage seem decreasing despite calls deep learning community. reason mnist popular size allowing deep learning researchers quickly check prototype algorithms. also complemented fact machine learning libraries deep learning frameworks provide helper functions convenient examples mnist box. work create good benchmark dataset accessibility mnist namely small size straightforward encoding permissive license. took approach sticking classes grayscale images size original mnist. fact change needs dataset change mnist dataset fetched. moreover fashion-mnist poses challenging classiﬁcation task simple mnist digits data whereas latter trained accuracies reported ciregan fashion-mnist based assortment zalando’s website. every fashion product zalando pictures shot professional photographers demonstrating different aspects product i.e. front back looks details looks model outﬁt. original picture light-gray background stored jpeg format. efﬁciently serving different frontend components original picture resampled multiple resolutions e.g. large medium small thumbnail tiny. front look thumbnail images unique products build fashion-mnist. products come different gender groups women kids neutral. particular whitecolor products included dataset contrast background. thumbnails following conversion pipeline visualized figure figure diagram conversion process used generate fashion-mnist dataset. examples dress sandals categories depicted respectively. column represents step described section finally dataset divided training test set. training receives randomlyselected examples class. images labels stored format mnist data designed storing vectors multidimensional matrices. result ﬁles listed table sort examples labels storing resulting smaller label ﬁles compression comparing mnist. also easier retrieve examples certain class label. data shufﬂing therefore left algorithm developer. provide classiﬁcation results table form benchmark data set. algorithms repeated times shufﬂing training data average accuracy test reported. benchmark mnist dataset also included side-by-side comparison. comprehensive table explanations algorithms found https//github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. paper introduced fashion-mnist fashion product images dataset intended dropreplacement mnist whilst providing challenging alternative benchmarking machine learning algorithm. images fashion-mnist converted format matches mnist dataset making immediately compatible machine learning package capable working original mnist dataset.", "year": 2017}
