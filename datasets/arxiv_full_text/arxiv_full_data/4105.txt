{"title": "Discovery Radiomics via StochasticNet Sequencers for Cancer Detection", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Radiomics has proven to be a powerful prognostic tool for cancer detection, and has previously been applied in lung, breast, prostate, and head-and-neck cancer studies with great success. However, these radiomics-driven methods rely on pre-defined, hand-crafted radiomic feature sets that can limit their ability to characterize unique cancer traits. In this study, we introduce a novel discovery radiomics framework where we directly discover custom radiomic features from the wealth of available medical imaging data. In particular, we leverage novel StochasticNet radiomic sequencers for extracting custom radiomic features tailored for characterizing unique cancer tissue phenotype. Using StochasticNet radiomic sequencers discovered using a wealth of lung CT data, we perform binary classification on 42,340 lung lesions obtained from the CT scans of 93 patients in the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Preliminary results show significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating the potential of the proposed discovery radiomics framework for improving cancer screening and diagnosis.", "text": "radiomics proven powerful prognostic tool cancer detection previously applied lung breast prostate head-and-neck cancer studies great success. however radiomics-driven methods rely pre-deﬁned hand-crafted radiomic feature sets limit ability characterize unique cancer traits. study introduce novel discovery radiomics framework directly discover custom radiomic features wealth available medical imaging data. particular leverage novel stochasticnet radiomic sequencers extracting custom radiomic features tailored characterizing unique cancer tissue phenotype. using stochasticnet radiomic sequencers discovered using wealth lung data perform binary classiﬁcation lung lesions obtained scans patients lidc-idri dataset. preliminary results show signiﬁcant improvement previous state-of-the-art methods indicating potential proposed discovery radiomics framework improving cancer screening diagnosis. radiomics promising powerful prognostic method detection cancerous tissue. referring high-throughput extraction analysis large amounts quantitative imagingbased features standardized medical imaging data radiomics allows quantitative tumour phenotype characterizations cancer detection prognosis high-dimensional mineable feature space radiomics previously applied lung breast prostate head-andneck cancer patient cases demonstrated prognostic power radiomics potential radiomic features personalized medicine risk stratiﬁcation predicting patient outcomes. however radiomic-driven methods rely pre-deﬁned hand-crafted quantitative features based intensity texture shape able fully characterize unique traits speciﬁc forms cancer. such uncover quantitative radiomic features tailored characterizing unique cancer phenotype standardized imaging data highly desired. study introduce novel discovery radiomics framework bypass conventional predeﬁned hand-crafted radiomic feature models directly discover custom radiomic feature models abundance readily available medical imaging data. discovery radiomics potential abstract features capture unique characteristics cancer phenotypes beyond predeﬁned feature models extract allowing improved personalized medicine. methods proposed discovery radiomics framework described follows given past radiology data corresponding pathology-veriﬁed radiologist tissue annotations medical imaging data archive radiomic sequencer discovery process learns radiomics sequencer extract highly customized radiomic features tailored characterizing unique tisfigure overview proposed discovery radiomics framework cancer detection. custom radiomic sequencer discovered past medical imaging data;
