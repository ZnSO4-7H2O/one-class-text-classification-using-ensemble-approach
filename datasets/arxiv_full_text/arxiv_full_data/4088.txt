{"title": "Image Processing based Systems and Techniques for the Recognition of  Ancient and Modern Coins", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Coins are frequently used in everyday life at various places like in banks, grocery stores, supermarkets, automated weighing machines, vending machines etc. So, there is a basic need to automate the counting and sorting of coins. For this machines need to recognize the coins very fast and accurately, as further transaction processing depends on this recognition. Three types of systems are available in the market: Mechanical method based systems, Electromagnetic method based systems and Image processing based systems. This paper presents an overview of available systems and techniques based on image processing to recognize ancient and modern coins.", "text": "recent years coin recognition systems based images also
