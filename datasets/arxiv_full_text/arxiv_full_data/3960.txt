{"title": "Explicit Learning: an Effort towards Human Scheduling Algorithms", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI"], "abstract": "Scheduling problems are generally NP-hard combinatorial problems, and a lot of research has been done to solve these problems heuristically. However, most of the previous approaches are problem-specific and research into the development of a general scheduling algorithm is still in its infancy.  Mimicking the natural evolutionary process of the survival of the fittest, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have attracted much attention in solving difficult scheduling problems in recent years. Some obstacles exist when using GAs: there is no canonical mechanism to deal with constraints, which are commonly met in most real-world scheduling problems, and small changes to a solution are difficult. To overcome both difficulties, indirect approaches have been presented (in [1] and [2]) for nurse scheduling and driver scheduling, where GAs are used by mapping the solution space, and separate decoding routines then build solutions to the original problem.", "text": "scheduling problems generally np-hard combinatorial problems research done solve problems heuristically. however previous approaches problem-specific research development general scheduling algorithm still infancy. mimicking natural evolutionary process survival fittest genetic algorithms attracted much attention solving difficult scheduling problems recent years. obstacles exist using canonical mechanism deal constraints commonly real-world scheduling problems small changes solution difficult. overcome difficulties indirect approaches presented nurse scheduling driver scheduling used mapping solution space separate decoding routines build solutions original problem. previous indirect learning implicit restricted efficient adjustment weights rules used construct schedules. major limitation approaches learn nonhuman like existing construction algorithms best weight combination found rules used construction process fixed iteration. however normally long sequence moves needed construct schedule using fixed rules move thus unreasonable coherent human learning processes. human scheduler working normally builds schedule step step following rules. much practice scheduler gradually masters knowledge solution parts well others. identify good parts aware solution quality even scheduling process completed thus ability finish schedule using flexible rather fixed rules. research intend design human-like scheduling algorithms using ideas derived bayesian optimization algorithms learning classifier systems implement explicit learning past solutions. solutions bayesian network directed acyclic graph node corresponding variable variable corresponding individual rule schedule constructed step step. conditional probabilities computed according initial promising solutions. subsequently instance node generated using corresponding conditional probabilities values nodes generated. another rule strings generated replace previous strings based fitness selection. stopping conditions bayesian network updated using current good rule strings. algorithm thereby tries explicitly identify promising building blocks. noted scheduling problems structure network model known variables fully observed. case goal learning find rule values maximize likelihood training data. thus learning amount ‘counting’ case multinomial distributions. approach rule strength showing current usefulness system strength constantly assessed implement sophisticated learning based previous solutions improved lcs-based algorithm designed consists following three steps. initialization step assign rule stage constant initial strength. rules selected using roulette wheel strategy. next step reinforce strengths rules used previous solution keeping strength unused rules unchanged. selection step select fitter rules next generation. envisaged part algorithm used hill climber algorithm. exciting ambitious research might provide steppingstone class scheduling algorithms. data sets nurse scheduling mall problems used test-beds. envisaged concept proven successful implemented general scheduling algorithms. also hoped research give preliminary answers include human-like learning scheduling algorithms therefore interest researchers practitioners areas scheduling evolutionary computation.", "year": 2008}
