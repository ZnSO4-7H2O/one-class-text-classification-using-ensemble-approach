{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Multimodal Deception Detection", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "Automatic deception detection is an important task that has gained momentum in computational linguistics due to its potential applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet tough to beat multi-modal neural model for deception detection. By combining features from different modalities such as video, audio, and text along with Micro-Expression features, we show that detecting deception in real life videos can be more accurate. Experimental results on a dataset of real-life deception videos show that our model outperforms existing techniques for deception detection with an accuracy of 96.14% and ROC-AUC of 0.9799.", "text":
