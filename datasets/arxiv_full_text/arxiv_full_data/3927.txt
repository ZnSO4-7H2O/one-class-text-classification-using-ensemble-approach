{"title": "Learning Polynomial Networks for Classification of Clinical  Electroencephalograms", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "We describe a polynomial network technique developed for learning to classify clinical electroencephalograms (EEGs) presented by noisy features. Using an evolutionary strategy implemented within Group Method of Data Handling, we learn classification models which are comprehensively described by sets of short-term polynomials. The polynomial models were learnt to classify the EEGs recorded from Alzheimer and healthy patients and recognize the EEG artifacts. Comparing the performances of our technique and some machine learning methods we conclude that our technique can learn well-suited polynomial models which experts can find easy-to-understand.", "text": "exterior criterion defined training validation datasets consistdb examples respectively matrix input data target vector. training data used weight vector supporting neuron minimize squared error pairs input variables neurons next layers. training validation supporting neurons denote input data matrices respectively. using notations describe learning method follows. obviously value proportional distance current vector region accordingly rule vector orthogonal projection vector hyperplane located closer desirable region previous vector therefore induction write scribed section algorithm allows connections different layers neurons. takes random pair neurons creates neuron added network values criterion calculated taken neurons respectively. growth network terminates pre-specified number", "year": 2005}
