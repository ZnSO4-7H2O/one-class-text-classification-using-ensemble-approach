{"title": "Learning what to read: Focused machine reading", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "H.3.3; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "abstract": "Recent efforts in bioinformatics have achieved tremendous progress in the machine reading of biomedical literature, and the assembly of the extracted biochemical interactions into large-scale models such as protein signaling pathways. However, batch machine reading of literature at today's scale (PubMed alone indexes over 1 million papers per year) is unfeasible due to both cost and processing overhead. In this work, we introduce a focused reading approach to guide the machine reading of biomedical literature towards what literature should be read to answer a biomedical query as efficiently as possible. We introduce a family of algorithms for focused reading, including an intuitive, strong baseline, and a second approach which uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns when to explore (widen the search) or exploit (narrow it). We demonstrate that the RL approach is capable of answering more queries than the baseline, while being more efficient, i.e., reading fewer documents.", "text": "recent efforts bioinformatics achieved tremendous progress machine reading biomedical literature assembly extracted biochemical interactions large-scale models protein signaling pathways. however batch machine reading literature today’s scale unfeasible cost processing overhead. work introduce focused reading approach guide machine reading biomedical literature towards literature read answer biomedical query efﬁciently possible. introduce family algorithms focused reading including intuitive strong baseline second approach uses reinforcement learning framework learns explore exploit demonstrate approach capable answering queries baseline efﬁcient i.e. reading fewer documents. millions academic papers biomedical domain contain vast amount information lead hypotheses disease treatment. however scientists faced problem undiscovered public knowledge struggle read assimilate information furthermore literature growing exponential rate pubmed adding million papers year since surpassed large ongoing efforts bionlp task community darpa mechanism program making progress advancing methods machine reading assembly extracted biochemical interactions large-scale models. however date methods rely either manual selection relevant documents processing large batches documents relevant model constructed. batch machine reading literature scale poses growing problems. first access documents costly. pubmedcentral open access subset estimated comprise total literature;
