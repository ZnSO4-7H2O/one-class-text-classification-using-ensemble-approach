{"title": "Evidential Reasoning in Parallel Hierarchical Vision Programs", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient adaptation and application of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, one that can be used effectively in a massively parallel hierarchical system for visual pattern perception. It describes the techniques used, and shows in an extended example how they serve to improve the system's performance as it applies a multiple-level set of processes.", "text": "paper presents efficient evidence used shows extended visual pattern perception. example serve improve program's performance applies multiple­ level processes. hypothesized shape typical window shutter\". suggested used evaluate feature values typical feature value hypothesized function used program. apparently invented. belt belz. since dempster's combination order. knowledge representation technique past years dempster-shafer work includes the� graphs become becomes increasingly expected feature components hypothesized objects. probability values used answer questions typical elongated shape window shutter much feature shape contribute belief shutter discriminate especially edges eight possible directions level next short edges extracted edges levels nodes. pairs parallel found good clues windows rectangular shapes. horizontal located office building ease demonstration since procedure examined operations described succeed yielding false windows. step geometrical relations results. necessary 'lateral higher level nodes pyramid used. belief values levels passed level nodes level. surviv­ nodes search possible sibling window areas vertically horizontally found consequently qbel qbel checked knowledge source bined belief function verifying hypothesis window area question source represented paper describes pyramid structure computer vision. world objects transforms several program's judgments knowledge representation easy update. reasoning mechanism extends combination", "year": 2013}
