{"title": "Fuzzy and Multilayer Perceptron for Evaluation of HV Bushings", "tag": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "abstract": "The work proposes the application of fuzzy set theory (FST) to diagnose the condition of high voltage bushings. The diagnosis uses dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data from bushings based on IEC60599 and IEEE C57-104 criteria for oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. FST and neural networks are compared in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Both FST and NN simulations were able to diagnose the bushings condition with 10% error. By using fuzzy theory, the maintenance department can classify bushings and know the extent of degradation in the component.", "text": "apply fuzzy operators means inputs similarly boolean algebra.
