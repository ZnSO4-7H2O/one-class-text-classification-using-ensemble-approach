{"title": "Science Question Answering using Instructional Materials", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "We provide a solution for elementary science test using instructional materials. We posit that there is a hidden structure that explains the correctness of an answer given the question and instructional materials and present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs and instructional materials), and uses what it learns to answer novel elementary science questions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms several strong baselines.", "text": "provide solution elementary science tests using instructional materials. posit hidden structure explains

answer-entailing structures align question-answers appropriate snippets curriculum. student curriculum usually comprises textbooks. textbook in-turn comprises chapters chapter divided sections discussing particular science concept. hence answer-entailing structure consists selecting particular textbook curriculum picking chapter textbook picking section chapter picking sentences section aligning words/multi-word expressions hypothesis words/mwe’s picked sentences. answerentailing structures reﬁned using external domain-speciﬁc knowledge resources science dictionaries study guides semistructured tables domainalignment common technique many applications etc. three differences approach alignment based approaches literature incorporate curriculum hierarchy latent structure. helps jointly learn retrieval answer selection modules system. retrieval answer selection usually designed isolated loosely connected components systems leading loss performance approach mitigates shortcoming. modern textbooks typically provide review questions section help students understand material better. make review problems improve model. review problems additional value part latent structure known questions. utilize domain-speciﬁc knowledge sources study guides science dictionaries semistructured knowledge tables within model. joint model trained max-margin fashion using latent structural answer-entailing structures latent. train evaluate models grade science problems science textbooks multiple domain-speciﬁc knowledge resources. achieve superior performance number baselines. figure example answer-entailing structure. answer-entailing structure consists selecting particular textbook curriculum picking chapter textbook picking section chapter picking sentences section aligning words/mwe’s hypothesis words/mwe’s picked sentences related knowledge appropriately chosen additional knowledge stores. case relation equivalences shown violet hypothesized using external knowledge resources. dashed lines show word/mwe alignments hypothesis sentences solid black lines show coreference links text relation sentences. picked sentences contiguous sentences text. mwe’s shown green. reservoir external knowledge finally words/mwe’s hypothesis aligned words/mwe’s snippet knowledge bits. learning alignment edges helps model determine semantic constituents compared other. alignments also used generate effective features. choice snippets choice relevant external knowledge alignments conjunction form latent answer-entailing structure. represent latent structure question-answer candidate pair max-margin approach treat science structured prediction problem ranking hypothesis correct hypothesis ranking. learn scoring function parameter score correct hypothesis

concave-convex programming procedure rangarajan assume scoring function linearsw here feature discussed later. cccp algorithm essentially alternates solving s.t. achieve local minima. absence information regarding latent structure pick structure gives best score given hypothesis i.e. maxz complete procedure given supplementary. inference knowledge selection beam search ﬁxed beam size inference. infer textbook chapter section snippet alignments order. step expand promising substructure candidates far. inference select knowledge bits knowledge resources could relevant question-answer. done heuristically picking knowledge bits explain parts hypothesis explained chosen snippets. incorporating partially known structures describe review questions incorporated. described earlier modern textbooks often provide review problems section. review problems value part answer-entailing structure known problems. case formulation except review questions taken unknown part latent structure. multi-task learning question analysis component systems. incoming questions often different types different types questions usually require different processing strategies. hence also extend lssvm model multi-task setting question also pre-deﬁned associated type question-type treated separate task. parameters shared across taskswhich allows model exploit commonality among tasks required. mtlssvm formulation evgeniou pontil also used reading comprehension setting sachan nutshell approach redeﬁnes lssvm feature shows mtlssvm objective takes form equation kernel corresponding feature map. hence simply redeﬁne feature reuse lssvm algorithm solve mtlssvm. features feature vector decomposes parts part corresponds part answer-entailing structure. ﬁrst part index textbooks score retrieved textbook querying hypothesis statement. tf-idf scorers resulting features. then jaccard similarity bigrams trigrams hypothesis textbook features ﬁrst part. similarly second part index textbook chapters compute tf-idf bigram trigram features. third part index sections instead. fourth part features based text snippet part answer-entailing structure. deeper linguistic analysis include features matching local neighborhoods snippet hypothesis features matching bigrams trigrams dependencies semantic roles predicate-argument structure well global syntactic structure tree kernel matching dependency parse trees entire sentences text snippet contains answer question intuitively similar question well answer. hence features element-wise product features text-question match text-answer match. finally also features corresponding coreference links enable inference across sentences. tells sentences discourse relations related help answer certain kinds questions example cause relation sentences text often give cues help answer questions. hence additional features conjunction rhetorical structure label parser question word feature vector. similarly entity event co-reference relations allow reason repeating entities events. hence replace entity/event mention ﬁrst mentions results greater score. alignment part induce features based word/mwe level similarity aligned words surface-form match semantic word match antonymy ‘class-inclusion’ ‘is-a’ relations using wordnet). distributional vectors mwe’s obtained adding vector representations comprising words account hypothesized knowledge bits whenever case word/mwe hypothesis aligned word/mwe hypothesized knowledge produce greater score keep features alignment knowledge instead. negation negation concern approach facts usually align well negated versions. overcome this simple heuristic. training detect negation using simple rules test presence negation words partial order adding constraints require correct hypothesis ranked incorrect ones. test phase detect negation predict answer corresponding hypothesis lowest score. dataset used grade science questions released training
