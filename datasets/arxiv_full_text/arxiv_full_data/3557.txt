{"title": "CycleGAN, a Master of Steganography", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "CycleGAN (Zhu et al. 2017) is one recent successful approach to learn a transformation between two image distributions. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate an intriguing property of the model: CycleGAN learns to \"hide\" information about a source image into the images it generates in a nearly imperceptible, high-frequency signal. This trick ensures that the generator can recover the original sample and thus satisfy the cyclic consistency requirement, while the generated image remains realistic. We connect this phenomenon with adversarial attacks by viewing CycleGAN's training procedure as training a generator of adversarial examples and demonstrate that the cyclic consistency loss causes CycleGAN to be especially vulnerable to adversarial attacks.", "text": "cyclegan recent successful approach learn transformation image distributions. series experiments demonstrate intriguing property model cyclegan learns hide information source image images generates nearly imperceptible highfrequency signal. trick ensures generator recover original sample thus satisfy cyclic consistency requirement generated image remains realistic. connect phenomenon adversarial attacks viewing cyclegan’s training procedure training generator adversarial examples demonstrate cyclic consistency loss causes cyclegan especially vulnerable adversarial attacks. image-to-image translation task taking image class images rendering style another class. famous example artistic style transfer pioneered gatys task rendering photograph style famous painter. recent technique image-to-image translation cyclegan particularly powerful requires unpaired examples image domains cyclegan works training transformations parallel goal satisfying following conditions describe distributions domains images ﬁrst condition ensures generated images appear come desired domains enforced training discriminators respectively. second condition ensures information source image encoded generated image enforced cyclic consistency loss form ||gf y||. hope information source image encoded semantically elements generated image experiments trained cyclegan model maps dataset consisting approximately aerial photographs maps model trained epochs produced maps generated realistic samples image domains. begin curious observation illustrated figure ﬁrst take aerial photograph unseen network training time. since network trained minimize cyclic consistency loss would expect indeed images turn nearly identical. however upon closer inspection becomes apparent many details present original aerial photograph aerial reconstruction visible intermediate example pattern black dots white roof perfectly reconstructed even though area appears solidly gray. network know reconstruct dots precisely? observe phenomenon nearly every aerial photograph passed network well cyclegan trained datasets maps. claim cyclegan learning encoding scheme hides information aerial photograph within generated strategy surprising seems ﬁrst glance since impossible cyclegan model learn perfect one-to-one correspondence aerial photographs maps single correspond vast number aerial photos differing example rooftop color tree location. possible directly cyclegan encoding hidden information. zoom apparently solid region generated fact surprising amount variation. amplify variation using image processing technique called adaptive histogram equalization enhances contrast local neighborhood pixel present results figure comparison apply transformation ground truth training map. appear extra high-frequency signal generated map. investigate nature encoding scheme following sections. true aerial image distribution noise distribution. measures different aerial reconstruction noise added interested depends noise distribution experiments chose gaussian noise varied standard deviation spatial correlation figure depicts behaves function expectation approximated averaging aerial photographs. found attains nearly maximum value soon corresponds levels image quantized -bit integers. thus imperceptible modiﬁcation image lead major changes reconstructed aerial photograph. fact found simply encoding generated lossy jpeg compression destroyed reconstruction. also found quickly decays minimum value soon indicating information fairly robust low-frequency content including perceive itself. suggests majority information source photograph stored high-frequency low-amplitude signal within generated map. quite sensitive noise added show well-behaved perturbation created added towards manually create aerial images editing tree onto grass ﬁeld different locations;
