{"title": "Symbolic Computing with Incremental Mindmaps to Manage and Mine Data  Streams - Some Applications", "tag": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "I.2.6; H.2.8"], "abstract": "In our understanding, a mind-map is an adaptive engine that basically works incrementally on the fundament of existing transactional streams. Generally, mind-maps consist of symbolic cells that are connected with each other and that become either stronger or weaker depending on the transactional stream. Based on the underlying biologic principle, these symbolic cells and their connections as well may adaptively survive or die, forming different cell agglomerates of arbitrary size. In this work, we intend to prove mind-maps' eligibility following diverse application scenarios, for example being an underlying management system to represent normal and abnormal traffic behaviour in computer networks, supporting the detection of the user behaviour within search engines, or being a hidden communication layer for natural language interaction.", "text": "symbolic cells share weight value represent individual item transaction. symbolic cells interconnected cells occur transaction well. subsequent step mini-network becomes integrated mind-map itself cells become merged mind-map case identical using fundamental principle adaptation hebbian learning mind-map seen living engine initially empty grows time. since states connections cells change time cells revive well. focusing skeleton mind-map retrieve yields delivering strongest cell connections. although mind-maps often refer structure process ﬂuid signals like text streams mind-maps often claim associative nature fundamental principle. true however believe temporal character systems accepted well manage temporal stimulation comes secondly mind-maps seen veriﬁcative explorative perception talking mind-map software mostly refers topdirected production logically connected entities example work-ﬂows coherent cogitations whereas word explorative related learning discovering process logical structures. respect following applications refers second class mind-maps present algorithmic ideas temporal processing text streams contextual information. simple implementation mind-maps system anima. refers mind-map model incremental adaptive nature allows manage associations symbolic cells transaction stream input. anima efﬁcient processing management transactions time present related patterns inside stream applications targeting network protection network-based anomaly detection refers system-based understanding structure behaviour network trafﬁc respect identify abnormal situations. here mind-map model anima-ar implemented represent network trafﬁc events network packets including header content transaction promising application. fragments packet transactions meaningful symbolic cells within mind-map connects packet cells. additionally connection values established relating corresponding frequencies respectively. architecture rate usual network trafﬁc lower connection weight although frequency high rate abnormal/unusual network behaviour higher abstract. understanding mind-map adaptive engine basically works incrementally fundament existing transactional streams. generally mind-maps consist symbolic cells connected become either stronger weaker depending transactional stream. based underlying biologic principle symbolic cells connections well adaptively survive forming different cell agglomerates arbitrary size. work intend prove mindmaps’ eligibility following diverse application scenarios example underlying management system represent normal abnormal trafﬁc behaviour computer networks supporting detection user behaviour within search engines hidden communication layer natural language interaction. transactional streams understood endless data lost read. furthermore data classiﬁed categories example sentences paragraphs inside text document. categories form transaction items inside example words paraphrases. example transactional stream reading book text read exactly lost pronounced. management moreover analysis transactional streams often problematic several reasons. data streams potentially inﬁnite least known actually reached. storing whole data stream therefore option analysis cannot rely traditional mining techniques require whole dataset available need random access multiple passes data. currently research focuses processing streams different kind. typical techniques used data streams sliding windows incremental approaches synopses data. surveys current methods issues found discussion around mind-maps argue eligibility demonstrating applicability couple algorithmic ideas. understanding mind-maps seen adaptive incremental knowledge structures live depending occurrence input stream. ﬁrst approach stream data analysis mind-maps done processing transactional streams creation mini-networks. base transactional data mini-network consists simple university luxembourg campus kirchberg dept. computer science communication mine research group ilias laboratory. address coudenhove kalergi luxembourg luxembourg. email name surname uni.lu value although appears seldom. identify abnormal trafﬁc rated signiﬁcantly therefore tolerant temporal connection updates symbolic cells. following sequence pictures gives example mind-map used;
