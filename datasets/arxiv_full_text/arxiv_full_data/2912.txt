{"title": "Domain Adaptation with Soft-margin multiple feature-kernel learning  beats Deep Learning for surveillance face recognition", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.HC", "cs.LG"], "abstract": "Face recognition (FR) is the most preferred mode for biometric-based surveillance, due to its passive nature of detecting subjects, amongst all different types of biometric traits. FR under surveillance scenario does not give satisfactory performance due to low contrast, noise and poor illumination conditions on probes, as compared to the training samples. A state-of-the-art technology, Deep Learning, even fails to perform well in these scenarios. We propose a novel soft-margin based learning method for multiple feature-kernel combinations, followed by feature transformed using Domain Adaptation, which outperforms many recent state-of-the-art techniques, when tested using three real-world surveillance face datasets.", "text": "face recognition preferred mode biometric-based surveillance passive nature detecting subjects amongst different types biometric traits. surveillance scenario give satisfactory performance contrast noise poor illumination conditions probes compared training samples. state-of-the-art technology deep learning even fails perform well scenarios. propose novel soft-margin based learning method multiple feature-kernel combinations followed feature transformed using domain adaptation outperforms many recent state-of-the-art techniques tested using three real-world surveillance face datasets. face recognition gained importance security surveillance recently attracted attention vision researchers. surveillance scenarios problem face recognition difﬁcult image frames captured cctv cameras often suffer illumination distance-based attenuation factors thus capturing poor quality images. quality face images coupled resolution produce unsatisfactory performance recognition. several attempts solve problem recent past. traditional techniques fail cater changes resolution contrast illumination gallery probe samples. proposed approach consists three stages preprocessing feature-extraction soft-margin learning multiple feature-kernel combinations domain adaptation rest paper section details recent advances ﬁeld face detection recognition surveillance scenario multiple kernel learning based classiﬁcation domain adaptation. section brieﬂy outlines proposed techniques section introduces three real world surveillance datasets used evaluation proposed techniques. finally section gives quantitative results performance analysis proposed technique three datasets using rank- recognition rate metrics section concludes paper. widely used face detection algorithm proposed viola based efﬁcient classiﬁer build using adaboost learning algorithm selects subset critical visual features large potential features. proposed technique includes face detection technique based ﬁducial landmark points detected chehra face detector. large scale implementation support vector machine large number kernels known sequential minimal optimization proposed bach multiple kernel learning algorithm based sparse representation-based classiﬁcation proposed represents non-linearities highdimensional feature space based kernel alignment criteria. conic combinations kernel matrices classiﬁcation proposed leads convex quadratically constrained quadratic problem sonnenburg generalized formulation larger class problem. work proposed performs domain adaptation based calculation weights instances source domain. yang proposed method effectively retrain pre-trained target domain data based calculated weights instances source domain. duan proposed domain adaptive machine learns robust decision function labeling instances target domain leveraging base classiﬁers learned multiple source domains. tranfer component analysis proposed minimizes disparity distribution comparing difference means domains preserving local geometry underlying manifold. subspaces calculated based eigen-vectors domains basis vectors transformed source target domains aligned. wang considered manifold domain estimated latent space manifolds domains similar other. method unsupervised proposed samanta using properties sub-spaces spanning source target domains projected along path grassmannian manifold. surveillance cameras produce images resolution cope high transmission speed optimality storage data. besides degradation incurred resolution images captured surveillance cameras also contain noise distortions uncontrolled environment conditions during capture. matching algorithm based transformation learning iterative majorization algorithm kernel space proposed biswas known multi-dimensional scaling proposed coupled kernel embedding approach high resolution face images onto different kernel spaces transform subspace recognition. rudrani proposed approach combination partial restoration probe samples degradation gallery samples. outdoor surveillance dataset fr_surv also proposed evaluating approach. dynamic bayesian network based unconstrained face recognition under surveillance scenario proposed integrate information three cameras chokepoint dataset. work proposed aims bridge resolution contrast using superresolution contrast stretching probe samples degrading gallery samples. technique based eigen-domain transformation proposed make distributions gallery features identical probe samples. pre-processing described empirical values parameters pre-processing algorithms details) gaussian blur kernel degradation gallery;
