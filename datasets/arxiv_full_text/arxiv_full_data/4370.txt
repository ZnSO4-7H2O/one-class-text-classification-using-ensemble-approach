{"title": "Medical image denoising using convolutional denoising autoencoders", "tag": ["cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "Image denoising is an important pre-processing step in medical image analysis. Different algorithms have been proposed in past three decades with varying denoising performances. More recently, having outperformed all conventional methods, deep learning based models have shown a great promise. These methods are however limited for requirement of large training sample size and high computational costs. In this paper we show that using small sample size, denoising autoencoders constructed using convolutional layers can be used for efficient denoising of medical images. Heterogeneous images can be combined to boost sample size for increased denoising performance. Simplest of networks can reconstruct images with corruption levels so high that noise and signal are not differentiable to human eye.", "text": "paper present empirical evidence stacked denoising
