{"title": "Comparative Study and Optimization of Feature-Extraction Techniques for  Content based Image Retrieval", "tag": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "cs.MM"], "abstract": "The aim of a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system, also known as Query by Image Content (QBIC), is to help users to retrieve relevant images based on their contents. CBIR technologies provide a method to find images in large databases by using unique descriptors from a trained image. The image descriptors include texture, color, intensity and shape of the object inside an image. Several feature-extraction techniques viz., Average RGB, Color Moments, Co-occurrence, Local Color Histogram, Global Color Histogram and Geometric Moment have been critically compared in this paper. However, individually these techniques result in poor performance. So, combinations of these techniques have also been evaluated and results for the most efficient combination of techniques have been presented and optimized for each class of image query. We also propose an improvement in image retrieval performance by introducing the idea of Query modification through image cropping. It enables the user to identify a region of interest and modify the initial query to refine and personalize the image retrieval results.", "text": "content-based image retrieval system also known

expressed since wang database images vary ideal obviously means retrieved images belong class query image. greater means system over-worked resulting excess results. less means system underworked hence underperforming. means even accuracy might high reduce full potential retrieval process eliminating images class could user. analysis analysis techniques evaluated using parameters described before. assume accuracy termed ‘good’ performance less termed ‘bad’ performance. combined approach calculate mean time taken accuracy techniques find mean time seconds mean accuracy mean since individual techniques result accuracy cases combine results. time taken seconds. mean accuracy obtained mean results accuracy rates near perfect cases. drawbacks poor redundancy considerably long
