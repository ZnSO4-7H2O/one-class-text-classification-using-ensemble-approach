Our main mathematical result is that for any continuous gambling strategy used for detecting disagreement between the forecasts and the actual labels, there exists a forecasting strategy whose forecasts are ideal as far as this gambling strategy is concerned. A forecasting strategy obtained in this way from a gambling strategy demonstrating a strong law of large numbers is simplified and studied empirically.", "text": "consider make probability forecasts binary labels. main mathematical result continuous gambling strategy used detecting disagreement forecasts actual labels exists forecasting strategy whose forecasts ideal gambling strategy concerned. forecasting strategy obtained gambling strategy demonstrating strong large numbers simpliﬁed studied empirically. round forecaster predicts reality’s move chosen label space always taken paper. move probability forecast interpreted probability attaches event help forecaster reality presents object beginning round;
