{"title": "Fine-Grained Entity Typing with High-Multiplicity Assignments", "tag": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "As entity type systems become richer and more fine-grained, we expect the number of types assigned to a given entity to increase. However, most fine-grained typing work has focused on datasets that exhibit a low degree of type multiplicity. In this paper, we consider the high-multiplicity regime inherent in data sources such as Wikipedia that have semi-open type systems. We introduce a set-prediction approach to this problem and show that our model outperforms unstructured baselines on a new Wikipedia-based fine-grained typing corpus.", "text": "figure comparison type
