{"title": "Relevance of the speed and direction of pulling in simple modular  proteins", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A theoretical analysis of the unfolding pathway of simple modular proteins in length- controlled pulling experiments is put forward. Within this framework, we predict the first module to unfold in a chain of identical units, emphasizing the ranges of pulling speeds in which we expect our theory to hold. These theoretical predictions are checked by means of steered molecular dynamics of a simple construct, specifically a chain composed of two coiled-coils motives, where anisotropic features are revealed. These simulations also allow us to give an estimate for the range of pulling velocities in which our theoretical approach is valid.
