{"title": "Simulation of Spatial Systems with Demographic Noise", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Demographic (shot) noise in population dynamics scales with the square root of the population size. This process is very important, as it yields an absorbing state at zero field, but simulating it, especially on spatial domains, is a non-trivial task. Here we compare the results of two operator-splitting techniques suggested for simulating the corresponding Langevin equation, one by Pechenik and Levine (PL) and the other by Dornic, Chat\\'e and Mu\\~noz (DCM). We identify an anomalously strong bias toward the active phase in the numerical scheme of DCM, a bias which is not present in the alternative scheme of PL. This bias strongly distorts the phase diagram determined via the DCM procedure for the range of time-steps used in such simulations. We pinpoint the underlying cause in the inclusion of the diffusion, treated as an on-site decay with a constant external source, in the stochastic part of the algorithm. Treating the diffusion deterministically is shown to remove this unwanted bias while keeping the simulation algorithm stable, thus a hybrid numerical technique, in which the DCM approach to diffusion is applied but the diffusion is simulated deterministically, appears to be optimal.

special kind multiplicative noise proportional square-root ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. thus small amplitudes noise typically dominant. result simulating dynamics system demographic stochasticity requires special care; crucial instance noise cause amplitude become negative would occur naive treatment noise. problems especially severe spatial systems many local populations connected diﬀusion individuals. numerous schemes proposed make simulation spatially extended system eﬃcient. approach simulate individual-based model using gillespie-type algorithm rate event taken account next event picked complete probabilities. demographic noise arose typical original model discrete individuals exact treatment problem. however large spatial systems procedure prohibitively expensive especially large population
