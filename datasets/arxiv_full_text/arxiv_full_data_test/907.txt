{"title": "Analysis and optimal control of an intracellular delayed HIV model with  CTL immune response", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A delayed model describing the dynamics of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) with CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) immune response is investigated. The model includes four nonlinear differential equations describing the evolution of uninfected, infected, free HIV viruses, and CTL immune response cells. It includes also intracellular delay and two treatments (two controls). While the aim of first treatment consists to block the viral proliferation, the role of the second is to prevent new infections. Firstly, we prove the well-posedness of the problem by establishing some positivity and boundedness results. Next, we give some conditions that insure the local asymptotic stability of the endemic and disease-free equilibria. Finally, an optimal control problem, associated with the intracellular delayed HIV model with CTL immune response, is posed and investigated. The problem is shown to have an unique solution, which is characterized via Pontryagin's minimum principle for problems with delays. Numerical simulations are performed, confirming stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria and illustrating the effectiveness of the two incorporated treatments via optimal control.

addressed appropriate functional framework needs speciﬁed. ﬁrst consider banach space continuous mappings equipped sup-norm clear negative real parts negative real part suppose prove stability rouch´e’s theorem. that need prove roots characteristic equation cannot pure imaginary roots cannot cross imaginary axis. suppose contrary. purely imaginary root then positive solution therefore root implying root cannot intersect pure imaginary axis. therefore roots negative real parts disease-free equilibrium locally asymptotically stable addition easy show real positive root indeed routh–hurwitz stability criterion follows roots negative real part. thus locally asymptotically stable suppose pure imaginary roots replace separate real imaginary parts obtain λβan limζ→+∞ hence positive solution therefore root implying root cannot cross purely imaginary axis. thus roots negative real parts. then locally asymptotically stable therefore rouch´e’s theorem cannot conclude anything stability numerically however show endemic equilibrium locally asymptotically stable certain values example case easy show analytically characteristic equation given thus derivative always positive therefore nonnegative real roots. analogously show numerically locally asymptotically stable positive values time delay general result remains however open question. here represents efﬁciency
