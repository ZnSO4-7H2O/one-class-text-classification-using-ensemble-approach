{"title": "Hippocampal and striatal involvement in cognitive tasks: a computational  model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The hippocampus and the striatum support episodic and procedural memory, respectively, and \"place\" and \"response\" learning within spatial navigation. Recently this dichotomy has been linked to \"model-based\" and \"model-free\" reinforcement learning. Here we present a well-constrained neural model of how both systems support spatial navigation, and apply the same model to more abstract problems such as sequential decision making. In particular, we show that if a task can be transformed into a Markov Decision Process, the machinery provided by the hippocampus and striatum can be utilized to solve it. These results show how the hippocampal complex can represent non-spatial problems, including context, probabilities and action-dependent information, in support of \"model-based\" reinforcement learning to complement learning within the striatum.
