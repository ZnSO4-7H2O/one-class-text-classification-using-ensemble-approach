{"title": "Doing Things Twice (Or Differently): Strategies to Identify Studies for  Targeted Validation", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The \"reproducibility crisis\" has been a highly visible source of scientific controversy and dispute. Here, I propose and review several avenues for identifying and prioritizing research studies for the purpose of targeted validation. Of the various proposals discussed, I identify scientific data science as being a strategy that merits greater attention among those interested in reproducibility. I argue that the tremendous potential of scientific data science for uncovering high-value research studies is a significant and rarely discussed benefit of the transition to a fully open-access publishing model.
