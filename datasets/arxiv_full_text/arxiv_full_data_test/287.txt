{"title": "Survey techniques, detection probabilities, and the relative abundance  of the carnivore guild on the Apostle Islands (2014-2016)", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Carnivores are important components of ecosystems with wide-ranging effects on ecological communities.We studied the carnivore community in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS), where the presence, distribution, and populations of carnivores was largely unknown. We developed a systematic method to deploy camera traps across a grid while targeting fine-scale features to maximize carnivore detection (Appendix 1), including systematic methods for organizing and tagging the photo data (Appendix 2). We deployed 88 cameras on 13 islands from 2014-2016. We collected 92,694 photographs across 18,721 trap nights, including 3,591 wildlife events and 1,070 carnivore events. We had a mean of 6.6 cameras per island (range 2-30), and our camera density averaged 1.23 (range 0.74-3.08) cameras/ km2. We detected 27 species and 10 terrestrial carnivores, including surprising detections of American martens (Martes americana) and gray wolves (Canis lupus). The mean richness of carnivores on an island was 3.23 (range 0-10). The best single variable to explain carnivore richness on the Apostle Islands was island size, while the best model was island size (positive correlation) and distance from mainland (negative correlation) (R2 = 0.92). Relative abundances for carnivores ranged from a low of 0.01 for weasels (Mustela spp.) to a high of 2.64 for black bears (Ursus americanus), and the relative abundance of a species was significantly correlated with the number of islands on which they were found. Carnivore occupancy ranged from lows of 0.09 for gray wolves and 0.11 for weasels to a high of 0.82 for black bears. Fuller understanding of APIS ecology will require on-going monitoring of carnivores to evaluate temporal dynamics as well as related ecological evaluations (e.g. small mammal dynamics, plant community dynamics) to understand trophic effects.
