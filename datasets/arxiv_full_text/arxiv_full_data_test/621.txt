{"title": "Network translation and steady state properties of chemical reaction  systems", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Network translation has recently been used to establish steady state properties of mass action systems by corresponding the given system to a generalized one which is either dynamically or steady state equivalent. In this work we further use network translation to identify network structures which give rise to the well-studied property of absolute concentration robustness in the corresponding mass action systems. In addition to establishing the capacity for absolute concentration robustness, we show that network translation can often provide a method for deriving the steady state value of the robust species. We furthermore present a MILP algorithm for the identification of translated chemical reaction networks that improves on previous approaches, allowing for easier application of the theory.
