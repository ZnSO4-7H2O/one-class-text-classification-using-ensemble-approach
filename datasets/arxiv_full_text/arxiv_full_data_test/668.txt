{"title": "Temporal precision of regulated gene expression", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that the optimal strategy corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time. Optimality arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the extrinsic timing noise of the regulator, and minimizing the intrinsic timing noise of the target molecule itself. Although either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy, when we consider the effects of cell division, we find that repression outperforms activation if division occurs late in the process. Our results explain the nonlinear increase and low noise of mig-1 gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during Caenorhabditis elegans development, and suggest that mig-1 regulation is dominated by repression for maximal temporal precision. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.
