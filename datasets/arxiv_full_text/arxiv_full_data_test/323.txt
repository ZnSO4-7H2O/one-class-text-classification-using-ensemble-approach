{"title": "Concussion classification via deep learning using whole-brain white  matter fiber strains", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Developing an accurate and reliable injury predictor is central to the biomechanical studies of traumatic brain injury. State-of-the-art efforts continue to rely on empirical, scalar metrics based on kinematics or model-estimated tissue responses explicitly pre-defined in a specific brain region of interest. They could suffer from loss of information. A single training dataset has also been used to evaluate performance but without cross-validation. In this study, we developed a deep learning approach for concussion classification using implicit features of the entire voxel-wise white matter fiber strains. Using reconstructed American National Football League (NFL) injury cases, leave-one-out cross-validation was employed to objectively compare injury prediction performances against two baseline machine learning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and four scalar metrics via univariate logistic regression (Brain Injury Criterion (BrIC), cumulative strain damage measure of the whole brain (CSDM-WB) and the corpus callosum (CSDM-CC), and peak fiber strain in the CC). Feature-based deep learning and machine learning classifiers consistently outperformed all scalar injury metrics across all performance categories in cross-validation (e.g., average accuracy of 0.844 vs. 0.746, and average area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.873 vs. 0.769, respectively, based on the testing dataset). Nevertheless, deep learning achieved the best cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC (e.g., accuracy of 0.862 vs. 0.828 and 0.842 for SVM and RF, respectively). These findings demonstrate the superior performances of deep learning in concussion prediction, and suggest its promise for future applications in biomechanical investigations of traumatic brain injury.

feature-selection approach improve deep learning classifier accuracy sensitivity likely indication adopted deep learning classifier architecture optimal. possible improve deep neural network architecture fine-tune hyper-parameters. however ill-advised. first clear guideline currently lacking best design deep neural network architecture. therefore exhaustive trial-and-error effort would necessary achieve absolute best performance increasing number neural network layers layer-wise units would lead challenges computational cost memory requirement. importantly known reconstructed injury dataset errors impact kinematics suffers undersampling non-injury cases therefore optimal neural network model best performance applicable applied typical general population. need cross-validate injury predictor using separate dataset recently explored topic research future. feature selection important without rather poor performance. likely typical curse dimensionality small sample size data

notably models differ material properties addition different brain-skull boundary conditions mesh resolution method calculate fiber strain even segmentation nevertheless improving model’s injury predictive power constant process. together welldocumented real-world injury cases comparison injury prediction performances across models important understand best improve. high training dataset necessarily indicate high level performance categories using testing dataset. example csdm-wb higher training performed worse cross-validation accuracy therefore important future studies utilize cross-validation rather training fitting performances objective evaluation comparison. superior performances deep learning baseline machine learning classifiers encouraging. however must recognized head model single injury dataset employed performance evaluation comparison. even validated head models could produce discordant brain responses important evaluate whether similar performance gains possible estimated brain responses head injury models. addition errors reconstructed head impact kinematics well-known resulting uncertainties model results implications injury prediction under-sampling non-injury cases extensively discussed. further dataset consider cumulative effects repetitive sub-concussive head impacts importance becoming realized. therefore deep learning classifier trained readily applicable injury datasets fresh training necessary. importantly feature-based deep learning classifier applied biomechanics before despite numerous recent successes across wide array scientific domains deep learning approach crossvalidation framework established stage continual development optimization responsebased injury predictor future. cross-validation using independent injury datasets value deep learning biomechanical investigations better studied. nevertheless limitations deep learning also noted. first empirical experience often necessary design network structure clear guideline lacking. fact feature selection outperformed deep learning sensitivity indicate deep neural network architecture optimal could still room improvement. addition unlike scalar injury metrics relying explicit features deep learning behaves much like black without obvious physical interpretation internal decision mechanism. therefore although explicit feature selection
