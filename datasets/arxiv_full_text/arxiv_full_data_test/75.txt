{"title": "The wisdom of networks: A general adaptation and learning mechanism of  complex systems: The network core triggers fast responses to known stimuli;  innovations require the slow network periphery and are encoded by  core-remodeling", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " I hypothesize that re-occurring prior experience of complex systems mobilizes a fast response, whose attractor is encoded by their strongly connected network core. In contrast, responses to novel stimuli are often slow and require the weakly connected network periphery. Upon repeated stimulus, peripheral network nodes remodel the network core that encodes the attractor of the new response. This \"core-periphery learning\" theory reviews and generalizes the heretofore fragmented knowledge on attractor formation by neural networks, periphery-driven innovation and a number of recent reports on the adaptation of protein, neuronal and social networks. The coreperiphery learning theory may increase our understanding of signaling, memory formation, information encoding and decision-making processes. Moreover, the power of network periphery-related 'wisdom of crowds' inventing creative, novel responses indicates that deliberative democracy is a slow yet efficient learning strategy developed as the success of a billion-year evolution.

network well social networks network scientists high school students. omplex systems often include substantial number components case random networks large number nodes would make formation system responses extremely slow inefficient. solve problem real-world networks often develop network core contains densely connected nodes. majority nodes form network periphery. peripheral nodes preferentially connected core sparsely connected other. network cores enable development fast efficient responses response-set complex system encoded attractors. attractors defined states complex system converges. stuart kauffman described random genetic control networks develop surprisingly small number attractors. recent studies indicated rather attractors represent characteristic responses wide variety complex systems including proteins cells neuronal social networks. following early work little shaw hopfield numerous studies rapidly growing field showed learning processes artificial intelligence networks lead development consolidation attractors. however know still surprisingly little mechanisms biological networks encode attractors responses novel challenge. number social science findings supported creative innovations often generated social/geographical network periphery core-periphery interactions play essential role implementation. recently several lines evidence related protein structures metabolic signaling neuronal ecological social networks indicated fast responses known stimuli involve network core drives system attractors findings following system-adaptation mechanism emerged. system experiences novel challenge network core fail provide coherent response; thus stimulus propagates periphery network. novel response requires substantial number weakly connected peripheral nodes. novel challenge repeated periphery remodels core develops attractor. core-remodeling weaken erase former attractors leading ‘forgetting’. however substantial knowledge supporting mechanism remained fragmented paper hypothesize \"core-periphery learning\" response schema acts adaptation learning mechanism complex systems describe several potential ways development novel system attractors. rior describing core-periphery learning hypothesis paper detail first list salient examples indicate duality previously encoded versus newly acquired system responses. roteins described residue interaction networks nodes amino acids network edges connect adjacent amino acids protein structure. core protein structure networks enriched hydrophobic amino acids. importantly network periphery often contains intrinsically disordered protein segments occur human regulatory proteins. protein core provides exceptionally fast energy-transfer localized amino acids demonstrated experimental findings molecular dynamic simulations analysis evolutionary conserved sequences. protein core tightly packed conflicting constraints forces lead ‘frustration’ several amino acid residues. analysis frustration rigidity changes help identification core segments mediating fast transmission well-known environmental changes protein structures. allosteric activation often induces inter-microdomain coupling expands protein core makes overall energy transfer faster efficient. thus allostery introduces ‘on-line’ sensor ‘well-known’ environmental changes. example proteins somewhat special since protein responses well-known environmental changes developed evolutionary selection processes long time ago. however peripheral intrinsically disordered segments enable fast adaptation proteins environmental changes. disordered segments often fold upon binding upstream signaling partner allowing 'conformational signaling' exemplified nuclear hormone receptor family camp response element-binding protein among many others. folding intrinsically disordered segments often occurs range seconds much slower either picosec time-scale protein core-mediated signaling nsec msec timescale conformational changes. conformational memory gives another example environment-induced protein dynamics. coli lactose permease displays lipid-induced conformational change remained detectable well removal lipid. similarly human glucokinase binding cassette transporter btucd retained hyper-activated state long completion catalytic cycle. kinetic forms allostery represent general feature many proteins introduced allokairy. self-templating conformations prions increasing number other intrinsically disordered evolutionarily conserved proteins induce heritable traits. addition prion-like proteins first hypothesized subsequently shown involved memory storage neurons. summary protein cores show fast evolutionarily optimized signal transmission concentrated amino acids. contrary peripheral intrinsically disordered protein segments provide wide range slower responses including upstream-signaling partner-induced folding conformational memory. etabolic networks network representation cellular metabolism enzyme proteins edges substrates nodes. minimal gene set-related evolutionarily conserved core environment-dependent periphery metabolic networks exhibit similar duality observed protein structures. network structure stabilizes metabolic attractors correctly recovered matching input. cellular signaling network states also converge attractors re-configured environmental changes. importantly cell differentiation modeled activation core gene expression processes drive shift major attractors progenitor differentiated cells. addition substantial number transient peripheral gene expression processes capture pathways responses specific actual input. metabolic signaling networks reconfigured signal-directed folding intrinsically disordered proteins well chromatin-related epigenetic learning mechanisms providing enhanced response repeated stimulus. requires studies whether direct indirect 'learning' processes preferentially modify network peripheries expected. current knowledge previously encoded newly formed responses protein structure metabolic signaling networks summarized table examples describe responses neuronal networks well-known novel stimuli. nodes neuronal networks neurons. inter-neuronal edges primarily provided synapses. pyramidal place sensing neurons hippocampus several highly active fastfiring neurons surrounded neurons less active slower. fast neuronal matching often imprecise increasingly occurs experiences locations. latter case spatial refinement giant weakly connected network neurons becomes particularly important. importantly smaller subset slowfiring plastic cells gains high place-specificity exploration exhibits increased bursting co-activation post-experience sleep. thus plastic neurons involved precise encoding novel stimuli become similar rigid neurons encode previous information. similarly enriched environment sensitizes mouse dentate gyrus granule cells enables fast conversion highly excitable tightly connected network cores encode information. similar core-periphery task differences could observed several neuronal structures shown below. substantial part motor cortex belongs giant weakly connected network periphery involved learning novel motor tasks. contrast motor cortex lesions discernible effect previously acquired motor skills. network core relatively resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis human brains. core-association task-relevant visual areas increased correct visual task solutions. core mushroom body output neurons encoded various odors highly correlated manner. contrast peripheral layers sensory input remained highly decorrelated. memory retrieval provides excellent example mobilization previously encoded response well-known re-occurring situation. recent study indicated repetitive activation visual cortex awake mice built newly developed stable neuronal core structures mobilized together imprinted. similarly core several highly correlated hub-like neurons formed mouse fear memory learning process. fear memory retrieval core neurons tended lead correlated neuron pairs network periphery resulted network-wide synchronous events. finding indicated neuronal network core acts ‘opinion leader’ initiating responses known stimuli. going beyond structural findings neuronal networks daniel kahneman described fast thinking determines actions encounter familiar situation. however event occurs violates model world encoded fast thinking neuronal system slow contemplative 'deep' thinking system becomes activated enables detailed specific processing. division labor highly efficient minimizing effort maximizing performance. initial phase response fast slow thinking often complement other. fast opinion implemented immediate action needed preparing slow deep thinking solution refinement. description summarizes massive number behavioral studies. examination role whole-brain connectome core periphery fast slow thinking processes exciting task future studies. conclusion substantial number corroborating findings suggests memory encoded extension fast-responding network core correlated neurons recruit activate neurons network periphery. memory retrieval processes previously formed core reacts first elicits general response periphery. notably relatively small number peripheral neurons involved memory formation reflect current experimental limitations daunting task obtain individual records substantial number weakly connected/correlated neurons whose sporadic activation novel situation precede recruitment limited number peripheral neurons network core. general specific resilience ecosystems previously experienced versus novel changes indicates highly similar response duality changes described previous sections. interesting example continuous reconfiguration process arctic seasonal pollinator community high ecosystem structural stability reached incorporation continuous flow newcomer species network core. importantly recent work ecosystem evolution showed memory phenotypes selected past facilitate faster adaptation whenever phenotypes selected future. moreover ecosystem memory also facilitate faster adaptation challenges recombination previously learned solutions. inally describe decision-making mechanisms social networks. well-known individuals often know forming tightly connected network core. core gives fast responses previously occurring situations often forms echo-chambers resulting significant confirmation bias. contrast network periphery provides wider range solutions core overturn suboptimal choices social ‘elite’ core-periphery behavior underlies importance expansion definition expertise; creation culture truly receptive ideas empowerment opportunity scouts. weakly connected majority network periphery role collective opinion james surowiecki’s proverbial wisdom crowds. thus development optimal response requires contemplative thinking entire community uses inclusive self-governing citizen-powered processes deliberative slow democracy. conclusion wide range examples listed paper strongly suggests development novel optimal responses requires contribution whole community. importantly perceived vote majority especially votes casted without previous extensive discussion subject based simplified slogans 'identities'. process deliberative democracy raises 'crowd' level experts agreement plato's ideas wellfunctioning democracy. core-periphery learning hypothesis known stimuli trigger fast responses network core whereas development novel attractors requires network periphery wide range examples described section dual response-pattern complex systems emerges. generalizing pattern describe development novel attractors hypothesis current paper. starting step stimulus reaches network core fast process shown nodes fig. illustrative videos additional supporting information. expected core nodes typically substantially higher number neighbors nodes connected edges large weight starting step following three scenarios happen. findings supporting hypothesis several recent publications proved node sets determine system attractors part strongly connected components directed networks strongly connected component fact mathematically defined core bow-tie networks studies showed core nodes play major role encoding system attractors; different attractors encoded overlapping subsets core nodes core nodes participating attractorencoding. since initial form hypothesis published preprint several supporting findings appeared support extend original concept. taking studies list examples together generalize following scenario. incoming stimulus experienced complex system several times before core nodes formed group drove system attractor giving adequate response stimulus. stimulus repeated again system driven attractor provides fast reliable robust response stimulus originates novel unexpected situation incompatible existing attractors core. thus stimulus provoke conflicting core responses inducing system fluctuate original attractors. stimulus propagates majority weakly linked peripheral nodes stabilize system. besides system stabilization peripheral node involvement enables emergence slow responses novel stimulus ‘collective decision’ entire network process modify position size saddles depth complex system's attractor basins. note emergent periphery-response slow re-organization periphery requiring large number rather slow stochastic steps also stimulus-driven case novel stimulus repeated peripheral network nodes involved scenario gradually reconfigure network core adding nodes exchanging nodes process encodes newly acquired response novel attractor system. core-reconfiguration weaken erase earlier system attractors thus also serve ‘forgetting’ mechanism. core-periphery learning hypothesis novel since connects previously fragmented knowledge capability model networks develop system attractors learning processes network periphery-generated creative innovations differential role core periphery nodes attractor formation large variety realworld networks. moreover hypothesis expands lines evidence general adaptation learning mechanism complex systems. rigorous proof several details three scenarios requires additional studies. extension core-periphery learning hypothesis detail potential mechanisms scenarios next section. limitations several possible proofs potential applications hypothesis described subsequent sections paper. mechanism formation consolidation system-responses? ‘creativity’ ‘deep thinking’ 'contemplation' 'deliberation' emerge biological systems? optimal responses encoded complex system’s network efficiently retrieved later? extension core-periphery learning hypothesis described previous section seek answers questions describe potentially general system-level adaptation learning mechanisms. persuasive learning mechanisms involves increase synaptic strength neurons. importantly hebbian learning rule related network core reconfiguration scenario edge-weight increases system encodes novel response nodes belong edge become part reconfigured network core connected high-weight edges notably neuronal learning involve several mechanisms increase synaptic strength changes bursting behavior excitability structure perineuronal nets. addition stimulus-mediated edge weight increases signaling metabolic networks fully established involve signaling-induced folding intrinsically disordered protein regions epigenetic memory-related learning mechanisms providing enhanced response repeated stimulus. edge-weight remodeling re-channels information flow network. re-channeling appears applicable general learning mechanism involve several cases subsequently described. drastic re-channeling information flow achieved re-channeling connects formerly ‘quasi-distinct’ regions complex system’s network. regions must reside sparsely connected network periphery highly dynamic weakly linked nodes connect various distant network regions previously termed creative nodes. creative nodes bridge \"structural holes\" ronald burt. various forms creative nodes different networks listed table increase creative node edge-weights particularly suitable method remodel system attractors. henri poincaré defined creativity connecting distant regions human knowledge follows create consists making useless combinations.... among chosen combinations fertile often formed elements drawn domains apart. agreement statement analysis million scientific papers showed highest-impact papers feature intrusion unusual combinations. recent social experiments simulations accumulation highcomplexity innovations required separation occasional connection distant groups resulting creative combinations. extensive study facebook comments significantly greater attention triggered messages combined themes seldom discussed together. cultural bridges often induced conversational themes acted cultural trellises. similarly wikipedia users prefer links pointing towards periphery wikipedia network indicating search novelty redundant core non-redundant periphery. findings regarding creativity agreement re-channeling information flow connection distant network regions described here. nformation flow efficiently re-channeled changing direction even single edge. little change drive system hierarchical control limited number nodes community-control majority nodes. duality closely related core-periphery duality previously described response pattern. edge-direction change triggered decrease rigidity rigid node importantly change direction edge introduce loops directed networks. dramatically increase plasticity destabilize/reconfigure former attractors. inally describe three mechanisms remodel network core encode novel attractors. importantly core remodeling also erase part previously encoded system responses thus also mechanism forgetting consequent system reset. case novel stimulus core nodes often trigger different responses. contradicting responses induce fluctuation previously encoded attractors. here ‘mediation’ contradicting core responses becomes useful. ‘mediation’ often provided coreadjacent non-hub nodes. species schooling fish notemigonus crysoleucas relatively strongly connected neighbors influential susceptible social influence. high influence inter-hub nodes also demonstrated large-scale social networks twitter mobile phones. notably mediating nodes often weak links resemble creative nodes previously described. thus core-conflict mediation contribute stabilizing strength weak ties initially described social networks mark granovetter subsequently generalized many complex systems. concept innovation diffusion mediator nodes correspond innovators here integrated early adopters predominantly belong highly active network core. creative innovations often generated network periphery. network periphery preferred position innovators contacts social communities free social pressure core-enforcing conformity. importantly external advisors consultants change agents typically occupy position hub-connecting coreinteracting low-degree nodes partially explains highly influential status. coremembers typically afraid changing status jeopardize prestigious position. thus traditionally behaving core members seldom become innovators. importantly core-periphery interactions play essential role spread implementation innovations. mechanism network core remodeling core-reconfiguration addition and/or exchange core nodes repeated stimuli transform core-mediation core-reconfiguration coreassociated mediating nodes become part core encodes novel response. core also lose previous nodes reconfiguration shown neuronal social networks. examples indicate core-reconfiguration induce weakening/erasure former system responses encoding novel attractor. thus core-reconfiguration also represents forgetting mechanism. mismatched stimulus also ‘melt’ part core decrease edge weights rigidity. increased plasticity helps generate novel attractors and/or makes existing attractors accessible. mismatched stimulus repeated encode novel constraints network structure establishing segment network core. core-extension makes network rigid again. plasticity/rigidity cycles characterize wide range adaptive processes. similarly core-remodeling discussed previous paragraph core-extension also enrich system newly encoded attractor. importantly ‘core-melting’ represent mechanism forgetting. slow relaxation high-affinity high-turnover protein conformations dissociation substrate molecular-level model forgetting. similar decrease network rigidity induce forgetting structure actin cytoskeleton neuronal synapses well perineuronal net. three mechanisms indicated minor changes network core lead gross changes network behavior. rather plausible core often determines major system attractors. however network periphery remodel attractor basins make attractors accessible inaccessible merge attractors divide large attractor basin several smaller ones. case repeated stimuli periphery effects reconfigure core encode novel attractors. examples showed learning mechanisms extended neuronal networks complex systems protein structures metabolic networks ecosystems social communities. assumption agreement recent concept watson szathmáry described evolutionary adaptation ecosystems learning process. section list limitations core-periphery learning hypothesis giving exceptions general adaptation mechanism described paper. however evidenced salient examples listed before exceptions represent majority cases. importantly speed response always discriminate core periphery responses. responses become slow either stimulus removed system corresponding attractor formation corresponding attractor requires long time. however latter process usually requires even longer time former since periphery reconfiguration stochastic requires many repeats emergency scenarios complex systems adapt initial approximate mismatched fast response core subsequently becomes refined slower contributions periphery. important scenarios response system remains fluctuating bistable switch limit cycle limit torus. leading widespread popular delusions. creative nodes prevent catastrophes. various forms \"madness crowds\" phenomenon creative nodes listed table cases core excessive number constraints. extreme core rigidity severely limits core’s portfolio fast responses. super-rigid cores reject stimuli appear ‘purposefully slow’ similar bureaucracies. core multiple segments example functional utility dissociated network core forming network modules interconnection brain modules identified process human cognitive functions. potential proofs support core-periphery learning hypothesis listed dual adaptive mechanism described paper contributes understanding signaling learning decision-making processes. innovations resembling core-periphery remodeling overcome overfitting slow convergence fooling effect catastrophic forgetting several current artificial intelligence techniques. recent internet innovations recognize importance internet periphery adapt variable challenges involve design adaptable internet core. finally network-based drug design recently emerged novel paradigm drug development. \"central drug design strategy\" targets network core \"network influence drug design strategy\" targets peripheral nodes preferably hitting nodes similar highly susceptible highly influential hub-connecting coreadjacent nodes described paper. conclusion wide range evidence indicates upon environmental stimulus complex systems mobilize fast pre-set response well-connected network core shifting system attractors. fails stimulus propagates weakly connected network periphery slow integrative response entire system develops. case repeated stimulus integrative response remodel network core encode novel attractor. thus wide range natural systems mobilize network periphery initiate process similar 'deliberative deep thinking' creating novel responses. studies coreperiphery-driven responses give insight adaptation learning mechanisms well construct efficient future technologies. generality wisdom crowds described core-periphery learning hypothesis indicates deliberative democracy efficient learning strategy optimized complex systems response unexpected situations billion-years evolution. century full novel situations previously experienced mankind. paper warns must substantially effort mobilizing hidden wisdom human communities deep thinking

attractors much greater chances accommodating actual status rigid node vice versa. case rigid node ‘melts’ i.e. decreases rigidity less rigid node direction edge becomes reversed. rigid node 'melted’? achieved concentration energy rigid node re-arrange inner structure becomes random noisier plastic. assumption plausible increased resources lead increased randomness network structures causes increased plasticity. energy received network become concentrated rigid node? observations protein structures indicated energy tends accumulate rigid segments protein. plausible since rigid segments
