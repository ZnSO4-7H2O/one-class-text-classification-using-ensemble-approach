{"title": "Towards physical principles of biological evolution", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Biological systems reach organizational complexity that far exceeds the complexity of any known inanimate objects. Biological entities undoubtedly obey the laws of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. However, is modern physics sufficient to adequately describe, model and explain the evolution of biological complexity? Detailed parallels have been drawn between statistical thermodynamics and the population-genetic theory of biological evolution. Based on these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and major transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of thermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving population. Deep analogies have been suggested to also exist between the properties of biological entities and processes, and those of frustrated states in physics, such as glasses. We extend such analogies by examining frustration-type phenomena, such as conflicts between different levels of selection, in biological evolution. We further address evolution in multidimensional fitness landscapes from the point of view of percolation theory and suggest that percolation at level above the critical threshold dictates the tree-like evolution of complex organisms. Taken together, these multiple connections between fundamental processes in physics and biology imply that construction of a meaningful physical theory of biological evolution might not be a futile effort.

considerations specifically origin complexity multicellular organisms manifest genomic organismal levels clearly genomes multicellular organisms animals plants haphazard organization typical high temperature objects characterized disorder hence complexity. conversely genomes prokaryotes viruses characteristic high gene density operonic organization much ordered corresponds temperature. discrete levels selection lead discrete levels biological complexity. modality biological evolution encapsulated concept major transitions evolution developed szathmary maynard smith units preceding level form ensembles become units selection. major transitions include origin cells pre-cellular life forms origin eukaryotes endosymbiosis origin multicellularity origin animal eusociality superorganisms plants fungi. within framework correspondence statistical physics population genetics readily interpreted analogs first-order phase transitions usually considered systems thermal bath temperature remains constant jump entropy related latent heat transformation. context biological evolution temperature corresponds inverse population size obviously changes mte. indeed transitions lead increased size individuals accordingly energy flux level organization example volume eukaryotic cell fold greater typical prokaryotic cell. effective population size well known scale inversely organism size accompanied abrupt rise evolutionary temperature. entropy-related quantity that perhaps counter-intuitively remains roughly constant evolution evolutionary information density thermodynamically coupled variables. coming back physics ultracold gases provide excellent example thermodynamics constant entropy formally first-order phase transitions constant temperature determined equality chemical potentials different phases. differential chemical potential changes temperature change given entropy value particle entropy density. adiabatic transitions corresponding quantity energy particle differential corresponds corresponds innovation potential turns thermodynamic potential. thus first-order phase transitions characterized temperature jumps exactly happens within framework evolution-tothermodynamics mapping first clearly introduced spin-glass theory edwards anderson modern physics considers glass distinct state matter intermediate equilibrium nonequilibrium characteristic property glass aging structural relaxation. suppose measure specific property equilibrium phase liquid solid e.g. resistivity metal equilibrium means that measurement repeated thermal cycle obtain value resistivity. glass measured value would slowly change measurement measurement. potential energy relief glass function many local minima separated barriers extremely broad energy distribution. local minimum represents metastable state. thermal evolution system slowly moves minimum another. importantly glass state non-ergodic state glass characterized order

potential relief glasses appears flexible generic model biological evolution. glass displays effectively infinite variability whereas life based discrete forms genomes defined sequences distinct extended intervals stability formal criteria glass state universal flexibility omitting important purely technical details described follows. consider configuration characterized function original glass concept developed disordered systems type randomness interatomic interactions. actually randomness essential clearly demonstrated concept self-induced glassiness turns systems satisfy criterion without randomness necessarily presence frustrations caused competing interactions different spatial scales. phase transitions sufficiently rich limited functions. systems would spontaneously glue selected configurations library form complex completely chaotic pattern. patterns might yield better models biological phenomena classical glass. words assume number discrete separated attractors energy landscape system consists glassy parts separated gaps. model immediately invokes analogy pattern recognition successfully studied using spin-glass theory clear analogy evolutionary biology fitness landscape elevated areas high fitness evolving population travel either upwards pressure selection horizontally neutral evolutionary regime separated valleys fitness crossed genetic drift discussed less obvious potentially important point concerns concept order disorder consider frustrated system competing interactions. system assume many states energy characterized different types ordering. system cannot choose states completely degenerate terms total energy remains disordered. frustration competing interactions concepts theory glasses generally states ground-state total energy different excitation spectra ground states therefore different entropies finite temperature. result free energies different ordered states become different degeneracy broken system becomes ordered choosing competing ordered states. case entropy creates order disorder rather destroying although second means violated. thus ordering equated meaningful complexity results directly frustration relatively simple physical systems. concept frustration source complexity seems directly relevant understanding biological evolution. conflicts genetic elements biological entities different levels organization result frustration permeate biology arguably obvious form conflicts competition evolutionary strategies parasites hosts genetic parasites different reproduction modes including viruses plasmids transposons associated cellular life forms emergence persistence parasites appears intrinsic feature biological replicator systems shown parasiteprotected systems inherently evolutionarily unstable frustration caused intergenomic conflicts drives evolution biological complexity indeed computer simulations wide range conditions consistently show that well-mixed replicator system

caused conflict selection pressures cellular organismal levels intrinsic feature evolution multicellular life forms stable resolution frustration involves control cell division providing evolutionary stability multicellular organisms alternative also common solution cancer sexual reproduction involves different level conflict eusociality obviously entails another seem much stretch posit frustrated states underlie entire course evolution life. evolution described percolation multidimensional fitness landscape dimensions correspond selectable traits genes thus thousands. simplest image landscape mountain ridges plateaus partially covered water. landscape paths water never continue whereas accessibility paths water level depends evolutionary temperature outlined above. applied biological evolution description appears quite complicated however problem becomes much simpler consider critical percolation cluster consists paths follow shores lines minimal fitness necessary survival good reasons believe actual evolution deviate paths cost selection case paradoxically multidimensionality parameter space drastically simplifies problem. percolation clusters twothree-dimensional spaces complicated structures many doubling channels dead ends non-trivial fractal properties contrast mathematically proven that space sufficiently high dimensionality structure critical percolation cluster approximated tree words cluster simple tree structure without double paths dead ends optimal simple line. important consequence tree-like structure critical percolation cluster high dimensionality space that typically passable route points landscapes. seems plausible multidimensionality biologically relevant fitness landscapes cause tree-like trend readily decipherable evolution cellular life forms level phylogenomics trend reflects coherence topologies phylogenetic trees different individual genes notwithstanding extensive horizontal gene transfer prokaryotes invoked question validity tree-like character evolution true small viruses genes case evolution adequately represented network thus although exact theory remains developed percolation perspective strongly suggests coherent evolution gene core resulting tree-like structure organismal evolutionary trajectories possibility speciation consequence high dimensionality fitness landscapes. such tree-like evolution appears fundamental property life stems basic physical principles. necessary condition evolution separation genotype phenotype simplest case replicator replicase existence genotype-to-phenotype mapping evolving genotype represented discrete state vector whereas phenotype evolves continuous space thus genotype phenotype represented pattern-like phases vastly different numbers degrees freedom. mapping genotype onto phenotype words distribution phenotypic effects genotype mutations non-trivial problem. self-evident condition evolution actual existence mapping i.e. feedback phenotype genotype least mutations result heritable phenotypic changes affecting fitness organism. type mapping distinct glass-type phases different properties presents problem that knowledge addressed physics appears require
