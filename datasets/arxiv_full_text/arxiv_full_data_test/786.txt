{"title": "Mathematical modeling of cholera epidemics in South Sudan", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In this work, we analyze and model the cholera epidemics that affected South Sudan, the newest country in the world, during 2014 and 2015. South Sudan possibly represents one of the most difficult context in which adapt the deterministic mathematical cholera model, due to the unstable social and political situation that clearly affects the fluxes of people and the sanitary conditions, increasing the risk of large outbreaks. Despite the limitation of a static gravity model in describing the chaotic human mobility of South Sudan, the SIRB model, calibrated with a data assimilation technique (Ensemble Kalman Filter), retrieves the epidemic dynamics in the counties with the largest number of infected cases, showing the potentiality of the methodology in forecasting future outbreaks.

aﬀette questa malattia enterica. agenzie internazionali come l’organizzazione mondiale della sanit`a nazioni unite lavorano fermare l’epidemie nonostante progressi tanto lavoro ancora necessario. modelli epidemiologici colera come sirb viene utilizzato questa tesi sono nati l’intento studiare meccanismi trasmissione della malattia fornire strumenti utili all’elaborazione strategie caso emergenza. l’approccio matematico utilizzato modello spazialmente esplicito principali forzanti risultano essere pioggia mobitilit`a umana. validit`a tale metodo stata comprovata dall’applicazione altri casi studio. vantaggi principali modello proposto primis quello considerare rete ambientale batterio causa vibrio cholerae pu`o sopravvivere muoversi spostando cos`ı l’infezione posti prima n’era presenza; inoltre modello tiene conto dell’eﬀetto aggravante delle piogge possono tramite lisciviazione degli escrementi delle latrine aumentare concentrazione batteri nell’acqua; inﬁne viene presa considerazione mobilit`a umana tramite quale malattia pu`o essere spostata improvvisamente pendolare quotidiano lunghe distanze. questo lavoro sono state analizzate studiate epidemie colera hanno coinvolto sudan biennio sudan forse contesti pi´u diﬃcili quale adattare formulazione matematica deterministica stata proposta dovuto alle instabili condizioni socio-politiche evidentemente inﬂuenzano ﬂussi persone condizioni sanitarie paese aumentando rischio malattie trasmissibili possano diﬀondersi tutta nazione. nonostante limitazioni descrivere caotica mobilit`a umana sudan modello sirb calibrato tecnica data assimilation riesce simulare dinamiche delle epidemie nelle zone dove regristra pi`u alto numero infetti mostrando quindi potenzialit`a della metodologia prevedere future epidemie. south sudan geography south sudan topography south sudan hydrography south sudan administrative division south sudan k¨oppen-geiger climate classiﬁcation water sanitation hygiene data
