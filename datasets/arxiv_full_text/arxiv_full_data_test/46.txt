In order to fascilitate large-scale computational studies of subdiffusive chemical processes, we extend a recently suggested mesoscopic model of subdiffusion into an accurate and consistent reaction-subdiffusion computational framework. Two different possible models of chemical reaction are revealed and some basic dynamic properties are derived. In certain cases those mesoscopic models have a direct interpretation at the macroscopic level as fractional partial differential equations in a bounded time interval. Through analysis and numerical experiments we estimate the macroscopic effects of reactions under subdiffusive mixing. The models display properties observed also in experiments: for a short time interval the behavior of the diffusion and the reaction is ordinary, in an intermediate interval the behavior is anomalous, and at long times the behavior is ordinary again.
