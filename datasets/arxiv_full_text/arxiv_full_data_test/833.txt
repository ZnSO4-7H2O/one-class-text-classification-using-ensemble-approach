{"title": "Graph Based Analysis for Gene Segment Organization In a Scrambled Genome", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " DNA rearrangement processes recombine gene segments that are organized on the chromosome in a variety of ways. The segments can overlap, interleave or one may be a subsegment of another. We use directed graphs to represent segment organizations on a given locus where contigs containing rearranged segments represent vertices and the edges correspond to the segment relationships. Using graph properties we associate a point in a higher dimensional Euclidean space to each graph such that cluster formations and analysis can be performed with methods from topological data analysis. The method is applied to a recently sequenced model organism \\textit{Oxytricha trifallax}, a species of ciliate with highly scrambled genome that undergoes massive rearrangement process after conjugation. The analysis shows some emerging star-like graph structures indicating that segments of a single gene can interleave, or even contain all of the segments from fifteen or more other genes in between its segments. We also observe that as many as six genes can have their segments mutually interleaving or overlapping.
