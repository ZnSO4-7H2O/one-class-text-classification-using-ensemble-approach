{"title": "Tenement house model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Most of the common used models of epidemic spreading allow contaminating many neighbors of a particular node in the network. They are usually analyzed by differential equations on probability vectors. We propose a model of epidemic spreading, which restricts to at most one contamination per time step and analyze it by discrete approach, working on vectors of possible states of the system. Theoretical predictions of epidemic treshold, stationary state and time needed to reach it are given and appear to be perfectly consistent with computer simulations. We also point ou that the model appears to be well suited to mimic epidemic spreading within student communes.
