{"title": "Meanings, Metaphors, and Morphisms: Theory of Indeterminate Natural  Transformation (TINT)", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In the present paper, we propose a new theory named \"Theory of indeterminate natural transformation (TINT)\" to investigate the dynamical creation of meanings as association relationships between images, focusing on the metaphor comprehension as an example. TINT models the meaning creation as a kind of stochastic processes based on the mathematical structure defined by association relationships as morphisms in category theory, so as to represent the indeterminate nature of structure-structure interactions between the systems of the meanings of images. Such interactions are formulated in terms of so-called coslice categories and functors as structure-preserving correspondence between them. The relationship between such functors is \"indeterminate natural transformation\", the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of meanings in a precise manner. For instance, the process of metaphor comprehension is modeled by the construction of indeterminate natural transformation from a canonically defined functor which we call the base-of-metaphor functor.

profound meanings. characteristics tint make clear characteristics tint discuss contributions metaphor studies. characteristics tint summarized below tint represents meanings images metaphors viewpoint important process metaphor comprehension constructing novel meanings interacting meaning target source. meanings target source determined relationship among images regarded structures images. therefore needed natural explain interaction target source structureto-structure interaction. previous studies seem able treat structural interaction effectively. although bowdle gentner tried introduce structure-to-structure interaction study metaphor they eventually one-to-one image mapping deal structural interaction itself. studies modeled process metaphor comprehension composition vectors target source represented semantic space metrics. example kintsch proposed predication algorithm model metaphor comprehension structural manner. predication algorithm represents meaning words vector high-dimensional semantic space using latent semantic analysis. then short vectors relevant target source picked combine centroid target source. although seems important predication algorithm tries model context meanings target source algorithm compresses information contexts interaction meanings composition vectors despite philosophy. vector composition seems simple represent structural interaction least explain novel construction profound meanings discuss previous section. tint provides framework deal interaction target source structural manner virtue characteristics. precise tint represents essential pieces meaning image metaphor process comprehension relationships among images using categorical theory stochastic processes. believe tint naturally models process metaphor comprehension interaction structure relationships. prospects present paper proposed fundamental concepts working hypothesis tint ﬁrst step. next step sophisticate indeterminate process mathematical cognitive studies manner. furthermore simulation based tint using corpus reﬂects space images semantic structures check tint’s adequacy. line thinking compatible idea word embedding approximately
