{"title": "Modeling the Effects of Multiple Myeloma on Kidney Function", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer, is associated with many health challenges, including damage to the kidney by tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We develop a mathematical model which captures the qualitative behavior of the cell and protein populations involved. Specifically, we model the interaction between cells in the proximal tubule of the kidney, free light chains, renal fibroblasts, and myeloma cells. We analyze the model for steady-state solutions to find a mathematically and biologically relevant stable steady-state solution. This foundational model provides a representation of dynamics between key populations in tubulointerstitial fibrosis that demonstrates how these populations interact to affect patient prognosis in patients with MM and renal impairment.

states include cases attribute deaths cases multiple myeloma diagnosed older populations; median diagnosis patients years less years old.– thus mathematical modeling related multiple myeloma focused breakdown bone remodeling process caused malignant plasma cells.– paper focus instead kidney damage occurs patients signiﬁcant effects kidney dysfunction patient prognosis. several studies reported inferior overall median survival time patients present renal impairment occurs approximately patients study knudsen grouped patients according degree renal impairment none moderate severe found median

retrospective study included patients swedish hospitals used estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate study effects renal impairment overall survival time types treatment. overall median survival time

myeloma kidney necessary ﬁrst consider normal renal function. humans kidneys made systems tubules called nephrons working units kidney. kidney approximately million nephrons kidneys body’s ﬁltering system help maintain body’s homeostasis. kidneys keep substances human body balance regulation removal metabolic waste. main functions kidney include regulation water electrolyte balance affects arterial blood pressure. kidneys also monitor excretion hormones blood levels prescription drugs affect body function well regulating blood cell production vitamin production. kidneys’ work involves transportation water solutes blood ﬁltration systems kidney. substance transported back blood excreted urine. renal disease patients usually present proteinuria general kidney diseases related multiple myeloma result kidneys’ reduced ability properly ﬁlter substances. types common tubular kidney damage consider proximal tubular cell injury cast formation. sources damage malignant plasma cells produce monoclonal proteins called monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains light chains subunits antibodies produced plasma cells ﬁght infection antibodies express types light chain kappa light chain lambda light chain. monoclonal myeloma plasma cells overproduce speciﬁc type light chains. common cause severe renal failure patients tubulointerstitial pathology resulting high circulating concentrations monoclonal light chains. proximal tubule cell injury proximal tubule cell injury caused free light chain interaction ptcs. free light chains toxic ptcs blocking transport glucose amino acids phosphates activating tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis causing excess free light chain endocytosis. endocytosis process cells absorb proteins engulﬁng them. important note monoclonal free light chains toxic kidneys fact many patients high amounts serum free light chain renal impairment. appears toxicity depends structure particular individual’s free light chains’ structure protein folding. high amounts light chains sign multiple myeloma useful laboratory parameter serum kappa lambda ratio. normal kappa lambda ratio compared situations renal impairment. level either kappa lambda light chains high normal ratio considered abnormal suggests presence clonal plasma cells. free light chains toxic ptcs activating tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis. tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis process initiated interaction proximal tubule cells free light chains activates inﬂammatory pathways kidney. sustained inﬂammation causes excess accumulation extracellular matrix eventually replaced scar tissue. made proteins collagens provides structural support surrounding cells cells cannot survive unless anchored ecm. scar tissue replaces part formation excess ﬁbrous tissue characterizes ﬁbrosis. process considered largely irreversible leads loss function proximal tubule cells stage renal disease tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis begins interaction proximal tubule cells free light chains main goal treatment reduce light chain production killing malignant plasma cells. initial treatment includes chemotherapy drugs hydration cases bisphosphonates lower calcium levels. also used treatment plasmapheresis involves removing blood plasma body treating returning body. similar dialysis used remove waste blood. plasmapheresis dialysis machines perform kidneys’ usual ﬁltering blood. renal transplantation usually considered poor prognosis patients primary situation model addresses increased free light chain production leads increased light chain endocytosis proximal tubule cells cubilin/megalin complex. cubilin megalin endocytic receptors play important roles renal tubular clearance reabsorption proteins. initiate receptor-mediated endocytosis process cells internalize molecules. involves inward budding plasma membrane vesicles containing monoclonal proteins receptor sites speciﬁc molecules internalized. increased light chain endocytosis activates nf-κ mapk proximal tubule cells. nf-κ protein complex involved regulating immune system’s response inﬂammation responsible cytokine production. mitogen-activated protein kinases direct cellular response mitogens proinﬂammatory cytokines. activation nf-κ mapk initiates production several different types cytokines growth factors proximal tubule cells tgf-β secreted t-cells macrophages stimulate immune response acts proinﬂammatory cytokine. produced macrophages epithelial cells. recruits memory t-cells dendritic cells inﬂammation sites. tgf-β protein controls cell growth apoptosis proliferation. cytokines growth factors initiate proinﬂammatory ﬁbrotic pathways initiate epithelial-mesenchymal transition type type polarized epithelial cells change assume mesenchymal cell characteristics. allows cells increased migratory ability migrate infection site increased resistance apoptosis increased production material. plays part renal interstitial ﬁbrosis sustained inﬂammation proximal tubule epithelial cells. fibrosis causes disruption normal genesis breakdown cycle leads excessive accumulation. eventually scar tissue replaces accumulation causes loss function ptcs. ultimately end-stage renal failure develop. secondary situation ﬂowchart non-endocytosed free light chains precipitate forming solids called tubular casts within kidney tubules. casts formed reaction light chains tamm-horsfall protein. casts partially totally block kidney tubules increases intraluminal pressure reduces glomerular ﬁltration rate blood tubular clearance light chains increases serum light chain levels resulting never-ending cycle. unless casts removed result permanent nephron loss. current kidney physiology modeling focuses modeling chemical exchange compartments kidney modeling gfr. depends body size gives
