{"title": "Detecting abnormality in heart dynamics from multifractal analysis of  ECG signals", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The characterization of heart dynamics with a view to distinguish abnormal from normal behavior is an interesting topic in clinical sciences. Here we present an analysis of the Electro-cardiogram (ECG) signals obtained under controlled conditions from several healthy and unhealthy subjects using the framework of multifractal analysis. Our analysis differs from the conventional nonlinear analysis in that the information contained in the amplitude variations of the signal is being extracted and quantified. The results thus obtained reveal that the attractor underlying the dynamics of the heart has multifractal structure and the resultant multifractal spectra can clearly separate healthy subjects from unhealthy ones. We use supervised machine learning approach to build a model that predicts the group label of a new subject with very high accuracy on the basis of the multifractal parameters. By comparing the range of scaling indices in the multifractal spectra with that of beat replicated data from the same ECG, we show how each ECG can be checked for abnormality for variations within itself.
