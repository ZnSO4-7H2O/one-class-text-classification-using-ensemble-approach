{"title": "In-phase and anti-phase flagellar synchronization by basal coupling", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We present a theory of flagellar synchronization in the green alga Chlamydomonas, using full treatment of flagellar hydrodynamics. We find that two recently proposed synchronization mechanisms, basal coupling and flagellar waveform compliance, stabilize anti-phase synchronization if operative in isolation. Their nonlinear superposition, however, stabilizes in-phase synchronization as observed in experiments. Our theory predicts different synchronization dynamics in fluids of increased viscosity or external flow, suggesting a non-invasive way to control synchronization by hydrodynamic coupling.
