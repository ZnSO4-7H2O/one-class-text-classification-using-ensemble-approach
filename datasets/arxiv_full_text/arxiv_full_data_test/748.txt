{"title": "The origin and early evolution of life in chemical complexity space", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Life can be viewed as a localized chemical system that sits on, or in the basin of attraction of, a metastable dynamical attractor state that remains out of equilibrium with the environment. Such a view of life allows that new living states can arise through chance changes in local chemical concentration (=mutations) that move points in space into the basin of attraction of a life state - the attractor being an autocatalytic sets whose essential (=keystone) species are produced at a higher rate than they are lost to the environment by diffusion, such that growth in expected. This conception of life yields several new insights and conjectures. (1) This framework suggests that the first new life states to arise are likely at interfaces where the rate of diffusion of keystone species is tied to a low-diffusion regime, while precursors and waste products diffuse at a higher rate. (2) There are reasons to expect that once the first life state arises, most likely on a mineral surface, additional mutations will generate derived life states with which the original state will compete. (3) I propose that in the resulting adaptive process there is a general tendency for higher complexity life states (i.e., ones that are further from being at equilibrium with the environment) to dominate a given mineral surface. (4) The framework suggests a simple and predictable path by which cells evolve and provides pointers on why such cells are likely to acquire particulate inheritance. Overall, the dynamical systems theoretical framework developed provides an integrated view of the origin and early evolution of life and supports novel empirical approaches.

stochastic event knocks pixel basin attraction. pross called property state dynamic-kinetic stability helpfully captures kind stability entailed. pixel remain attractor avoid falling equilibrium? possible reactions energy prevent entropic decay second thermodynamics means that order prevent delay fall towards origin reactions must endergonic. additionally since non-food chemical species susceptible dilution environmental flux also conclude sits metastable attractor non-food species must produced reactions within rate equaling rate dilution. rate production lower would sitting

pixels origin dead whereas pixels neither origin gravitational pull metastable equilibrium trajectory towards origin i.e. death. might consider probabilistically dead sense unless perturbation moves

important features conventional definitions life. first generally held alive entails ability grow. remain attractor state chemicals must produce enough selfchemicals enriched compensate lost diffusive

result pixel sitting position space always finite probability jumping position would predicted based general dynamical model. given jumps involve changes chemical concentration smaller changes

loss life pixel could correspond movement life pixel adjacent pixel. likewise returning life state could correspond movement life state pixel rather reincarnation. life acquired bounding membranes became possible distinguish motility growth allow clear notions death reincarnation. grow conclude state metastable equilibrium spatially explicit context expected shrink non-existence rather grow. thus ignoring improbable case concentrations around spatiallylocalized chemical state decline adjacent pixel sits exactly edge zone attraction alive implies capacity grow. fig. viability life state

case life state viable. sits outside zone attraction example dilution chemicals enriched rapid converted life state. case life state viable area life state shrink time. remain derived state perturbed change environment mutation. thus principle always possible pixel evolve metastable life state another. movement space described might discounted just change since adaptive process entailed. however discussed fully below adaptive evolution would effect life states differ expected longevity pixels robust chemical states become abundant pixels less stable life states. example things equal life states large basins attraction tend persist longer less likely exited chance concentration changes. additionally ways life states interact could cause expense others. example finds adjacent pixel occupies different life state properties states could result state taking vice versa. transpires selective process would result certain chemical states classified fitter specified environment tending outcompete less alternatives. phenomena discussed detail later. needs noted life defined potential growth adaptive evolution. reader might object chemical states definition deviate markedly life conventionally defined. example pixel inside candle flame receives flux long-chain hydrocarbons delivered wick oxygen delivered convection worth noting combustion requires liquid solid fuel greatly redox equilibrium local environment. conditions earth mainly result life reduced organic matter serving fuel oxygen reactant. result local enrichment different species flame example shorter-chain hydrocarbons carbon monoxide carbon dioxide. however flame alive definition capable growth example along wick second wick argue interesting life state probably cannot evolve. flame change time result

chemical system nonfood species whose residence time though finite much greater rate food digested waste released. identity concentration non-food species influence current environment also recent history. non-food species therefore cause system tend remain attractor unless perturbed another state thus posit subset dissipative structures nature namely entail longer lived chemical species provide basis complexification adaptive evolution. spontaneous appearance surface-associated life going explore adaptive evolutionary processes helpful develop sense evolvable life states likely arise first place. selfpropagating chemical state needs food components make chemical species autocatalytic energy drive reactions endergonic. however neither factor likely infrequent early earth planetary bodies even many natural human-made earth environments today. even restrict attention organic life known since miller-urey experiments investigations cometary material potential food species form spontaneously many situations. furthermore many natural energy sources addition high-energy bonds organic foodstuffs themselves obviously light redox disequilibria maintained radioactively-driven geochemical processes. circumstances environment experiences flux food chemicals without additional source chemical energy transition evolvable living state? main factor determining whether life state viable spatially explicit model diffusion particularly different rates diffusion food non-food chemical species. diffusion food chemicals system needed self-propagation higher rates diffusion supporting potentially higher rates production non-food chemicals. likewise diffusion waste species system often needed sustain high enough rates autocatalysis. time essential diffusion result loss non-food chemical needed self-propagation keystone species. potential life state viable keystone chemicals cases species defined based counterfactual fig. diffuse away another faster produced. formal analysis needed conjecture life cannot easily arise classes diffusion rate equal. possible keystone chemical species might happen lower diffusion rate food chemicals example larger molecules. however seems priori easier achieve life state keystone chemical species configured rate diffusing away still access rapidly diffusing food species. setting seems especially conducive differential diffusion interface different phases solid-liquid solid-gas liquid-gas. interface autocatalytic chemicals could persist grow diffusion keystone species governed less diffusive phase food provided diffusive phase. indeed origin life field focused solid-liquid interface least since w√§chtersh√§user setting seems well suited origin life know realistic geological settings liquid phase example ocean volcanic pool become enriched diverse chemical species adsorbed selectively onto specific kinds mineral surface. additionally mineral metallic surfaces serve keystone species themselves example serving direct catalysts reactions autocatalytic set. model life could begin keystone species become attached chance pixel mineral surface. example hypothetical autocatalytic shown fig. keystone catalysts tended become immobilized particular mineral surface food waste species life state might nucleate grow surface catalyst molecules formed retained close proximity adsorption onto adjacent surface. provided diffusion food waste fast enough relative rate keystone species lost surface one-ended growth life state surface would possible. consequently mineral surfaces seem prime sites novo life states nucleate spontaneously propagate themselves. although many principles discuss formally depend solid-liquid interface linguistic simplicity hereafter assume life states emerge adsorbed onto solid surfaces interacting food-rich liquid phase. mutations space point imagine abstract landscape many potential metastable attractor states become occupied spontaneous formation autocatalytic system

concentrations chemical mutational processes described would random respect dimensions space. depending whether species‚Äô production causes compensatory changes concentration chemicals life state could higher lower chemical complexity original state jumps away origin likely ones towards origin. means chemical mutations potential continually generate higher complexity states might favored adaptive evolution perhaps worth mentioning chemical species continue added cellular life seen prominently evolution secondary metabolites plants microbes. additionally borne mind mutation molecule envisaged loss chemical species appearance different one. genetic mutations special case chemical mutations general. addition chemical mutations space also explored changes environmental fluxes physical environment. changes push living systems states could self-propagating. furthermore possible sudden change back prior environmental parameters could result living system left zone attraction

unpredictability. evolution higher dynamic chemical complexity potential life state whether occupied corresponds divot space; attractor state surrounded basin attraction. complexity potential life states namely minimum euclidean distance origin point within basin varies greatly. first life state occupied evolutionary sequence arises chance changes local concentrations meaning must complexity. thus life always start close origin. fact even simplest known living systems complex arisen spontaneously implies life began lower levels complexity time leap-frogged series life-states sequentially origin. happened? evolutionary biologists famously stephen gould believed fact life must begin left wall complexity graph sufficient create illusion drive complexity words bias towards higher complexity constraint begin simple. case might defensible comes cellular life believe cell much complex arise without prior existence living evolving system lack life systems sitting chasm cells origin space suggests leftwall artifact insufficient explain observed pattern. think many scientists take given remarkably intricate life forms around today point intrinsic evolutionary drive higher complexity. framework evaluate whether adaptive evolutionary processes acting prior cellularization might favor high relative life states? first need consider complexity might tend enhance long-term persistence self-propagating systems living mineral surfaces. self-propagating systems always bounced life stated chance changes concentrations chemical species. distance stochastic mutation likely deny simpler life states sometimes favored seen example lineage move diverse uncertain environment much stable predictable happens evolution endosymbionts. rather claim flow towards higher complexity withstanding eddies yield lower complexity life states. move pixel dependent current concentrations abundance species expected change proportional concentration high abundance species. means that assuming factors equivalent higher complexity states higher mean concentrations robust mutation lower complexity states. mechanism similar analyzed formally england suggested that environment rich potential energy sources difficult access life states exploit energy gain stability dissipate energy locally makes difficult random process take life state. foregoing argument attractive many factors could swamp mutational robustness advantage high complexity states. start life state becomes nucleated grows surface acquires internal correction system give resistance death-by-mutation. pixel larger living system knocked life state began equilibrate environment growth adjacent pixels would tend return dead pixel back life state. indeed beauties surface metabolism model early life large enough surface systems life state resistant lethal perturbations whilst still allowing many opportunities chemical mutations life states propagate whole system. result differences growth rate among living states would obviously correlate complexity could main evolutionary driver casting doubt preceding claim mutational stability sufficient explain complexification surface associated life states important driver complexity change might reside outcomes interactions adjacent pixels different life states. pair unbounded growing life states come contact three possible outcomes annihilation life states cancel meaning pixels moved life state; coexistence states merge meaning chemical states coexist pixel grow other; replacement state wins meaning grows state converting pixels losing winning state. specifically effect scale square root number molecules. addition conferring mutation resistance spatial extent also protects living systems parasitic chemical species species catalyze production pixel expense keystone species. shown boerlijst hogeweg k√∂nny≈± spatial structuring selfpropagating systems provides degree parasite resistance. indeed spatially explicit models parasites pretty hard time killing host parasites even yield unexpected evolutionary benefits major determinant growth rate likely rate production keystone species might thought keystone species‚Äô rate diffusion surface. annihilation expected outcome systems depend certain flux food chemical insufficient support either autocatalytic rate diffusive loss. alternatively interactions among non-food chemicals could produce poisonous parasitic products. however since annihilation removes life-states play role increasing complexity life states exist making irrelevant question hand. coexistence increases number chemical species elevated concentration thereby raising complexity environmental equilibrium point. outcome facilitated cases non-food chemicals enriched autocatalytic sets compete food attachment points surface cross-react produce poisons. coexistence could passive sense neither products reactants shared original autocatalytic systems neither compete cooperate another. sometimes however coexistence might entail cooperation waste products used and/or degraded passively even syntrophy network produces waste product value other. seems reasonable assume cooperative systems would robust long prior theoretical work research needed evaluate evolutionary consequences passive cooperative coexistence means complexification. replacement also potential systematically increase complexity since entails life state replacing another. complexity shown correlate competitive ability would found additional natural driver increasing complexity pre-cellular stage. easy enough propose certain chemical features might expected confer competitive advantage. example chemical systems whose foodharvesting steps high affinity might systematic advantage systems lower affinity food compounds. similarly systems enriched chemicals bind surface strongly lower diffusion rates would also expected predominate time however imagine several chemical factors none would obviously tend correlate complexity. nonetheless conjecture ought general tendency complex autocatalytic states replace less complex ones simply former superior ability take-over adjacent pixels. first consider case high complexity state pixel interacts lower complexity state adjacent pixel diagonal origin space. states contain exactly species proportion different absolute concentrations. stipulating self-propagating absence interactions life states know convert adjacent pixel state equilibrium environment respectively. stands reason convert adjacent pixel lacking chemical state could certainly convert concentration seen state hand reason expect could convert fig. possible outcomes interactions among different life states depicted blue red. state. assuming true non-food species reason assume replace case. reasoning generalized suggest replace cases different growing life states chemical species satisfy inequality example suppose identical concentrations chemicals except chemical species part autocatalytic acting absent example autocatalytic depicted fig. fig. also includes seems inescapable replace meaning additional chemical species spread throughout areas previously occupied state. simplistic examples provide explicit guide cases chemicals higher concentration others higher concentration even case higher overall complexity said conjecture typically higher complexity chemical states succeed growing converting adjacent pixels high complexity state high enough productivity flood adjacent pixels molecules keystone species. would seem predict general tendency higher complexity states replace lower complexity states could provide general explanation lower entropy dissipative structures might tend accumulate evolutionary time. said formal mathematical models would needed validate intuition assess whether holds chemical concentration also applies internal energy term chemical complexity. boundaries cell formation generally held cellular habit existence populations bounded vesicles compete representation future generations make adaptive evolution efficient. however advantage future evolution cannot used direct explanation transition unbounded state surface-associated living chemical ensembles bounded protocells. nonetheless argue adaptive evolution surface life states framed concept chemical complexity suggest plausible evolutionary path cell. potential class non-keystone chemicals gained living system‚Äôs evolution self-organize form membrane system overlying solution chemicals might first form waste products could become enriched presence directly indirectly promoted rate production system membrane-forming species inhibited diffusion essential food species system toxic waste product system would parasitic could never spread entire living system. however membrane allowed sufficient flux food waste chemicals production could spread entire evolving system. context surface receiving flux food species overlying solution good reasons expect membrane-bearing life state arose would tend replace non-membrane-bearing life state encountered logic behind claim fig. scenario origin membranes cell habit. ancestral surface-associated life state supposed composed keystone chemical species weakly attached directly indirectly underlying mineral surface. amphiphilic chemical species formed self-organizes form overlying membrane. presence membrane allows accumulation novel chemical species membrane stabilized production bridge species associate membrane and/or underlying mineral. physical disruption release stable cell-like vesicle would initially capable reestablishing surface state actions bridge species membrane could come characterize membrane permeable species needed survive priori reason think membrane would also allow rapid diffusion species needed survive. result patch come contact patch membrane would likely render inviable. would disallow coexistence would also make much harder outcompete shared food attachment points. result time might expect higher higher proportion living systems produce overlying membrane. addition providing competitive advantage pairwise interactions among life states addition selectively permeable membrane living system significantly changes system‚Äôs evolutionary potential. follows many dissolved chemical species could become locally enriched membrane surface. rate chemicals expected equilibrate environment slowed threshold productivity autocatalytic systems also lowered effectively increasing number potentially viable metastable states. thus insofar vectors space scaled diffusion addition membrane could greatly change expected dynamical behavior. formation overlying membrane requires chemical connection probably non-covalent membrane underlying mineral surface likely bridging molecules systems would well suited long dispersal life state mineral surface. physical agitation could generate membrane vesicle included keystone species life state well bridging molecules confer affinity natal mineral system evolved. result vesicles could serve propagules allowing system colonize patches natal mineral within broad area argued previously propagules sort provide natural step towards evolution cellular habit. first autocatalytic system might metabolically active interacting mineral selection would gradually favor variants could grow divide dispersing liquid phase thus selection dispersal ability seen evolutionary driver origin cellular habit. formation cells changes evolutionary dynamics disadvantaging parasitic chemical species whereas spatial organization accorded twodimensional surface generally prevent parasites taking also makes difficult drive parasites extinction. however life becomes compartmentalized cells selection cellular viability replication ability allow parasites exterminated. resembles niche construction wherein evolutionary innovations taxon alter relationship genotypes fitness hence topography adaptive landscape. even compartmentalized living systems arise might expect take time cells function autonomous clonal lineages. tradeoff drives modern life experience varied frequencies sexual reproduction would apply. fusion would favored frequent sharing chemical species among cells evolving population would help prevent cell lineages drifting away shared attractor. follows average concentrations chemicals cells would average tend closer attractor either cell individually. although fusion favored means reduce drift chemical concentrations major downsides promiscuous fusion cells. first fusion cells close different attractors tend average concentration chemical species thereby move fused cell zone attraction either attractor. words fusion living cells immediately yield non-living cell. second fusion exposes cell risk picking-up sexually transmitted parasitic species. thus evolution mechanisms prevent fusion among cells cells surfaceassociated relatives could slow likely eventually arise especially among distantly related cells. worth highlighting although evolutionary transition population individuated cells within little fusion would alter evolutionary dynamics system still accommodated within dynamical systems view life proposed here. sense space concept works better cells uncompartmentalized surface-associated systems because contrast \"pixels\" cells objectively individuated. thus reasonable view axes cellular space corresponding concentrations chemical species cell relative chemical‚Äôs concentration environment thus position space well captures cellular complexity least cells evolve subcellular organelles. space conception applies well cellular life consider osmosis. space makes explicit tendency living systems equilibrate diffusion environment. thus stands reason chemical species freely cross cell's membrane tend internal external concentration unless actively synthesized degraded cell. furthermore insofar environment enriched species internal chemical energy influx environment tend lower cell‚Äôs complexity. thus water enters cell reduces concentration cytosolic components indeed lowering cells complexity. pull towards origin resisted transiently kinetic blocks mechanisms reduce diffusion sustained long expenditure energy. thus would like suggest space metaphor provides unique protocells analog inheritance systems discussed here. hybrid inviability basically phenomenon. noted cells acquire spatial substructures macromolecular assembles organelles simple tally number molecules type cell would underestimate true complexity. general framework thinking cell complexity provides direct link principles explaining membrane transport chemiosmosis. evolutionary invention autonomous cells entailed gradual weaning living systems dependence natal mineral surface gradual acquisition mechanisms limit cell-surface cell-cell fusion. important consequence acquisition population dynamics easily model competition among cells occupy different points space. multiple cells population might zone attraction metastable attractor implying tend converge point given enough time. thought cells genotype phenotypes altered environmental noise. cells though experienced history chemical mutation results sitting different life state might confer higher lower fitness thus essential aspects conventional population genetics individual level selection arise soon populations bounded living systems arise. particulate inheritance digital genetic encoding risk taking model suggesting cell habit sets conditions evolution digital genetic system involving discrete heritable states encoded informational polymer highly plausible. prior cellularization reason expect genetic system like seen contemporary life. however cells arise particulate inheritance follow characterized particular molecular species present cell prior division mechanisms place assure daughter cell acquires equal subset copies. although characterized space continuous variable concentration axis life cellularized axes accurately defined terms number molecules species relative number molecules expected similar volume extracellular environment. species present many copies cell discrete nature space unimportant. however provided cell volumes number keystone species high expect chemical species abundances show quantized changes generation generation. random cell division high probability leaving daughter cell copies low-abundance keystone species selection clearly favor mechanisms improve reliability daughter cells receive full complement keystone species. selection yield molecular innovations postpone division rarest species reaches sufficient number copies cell and/or ensure reliable physical segregation abundance keystone species daughter cell. furthermore segregation mechanisms evolve might expect become used higher higher proportion cell‚Äôs lowabundance chemical species. principle particulate inheritance could entail passing multiple separate keystone species rather singular genome. however many classes polymers possess right balance covalent bonds non-covalent interactions able function catalysts encode digital genetic information consequently hard subset polymers might become specialized repositories genetic information might evolve single large actively copied segregated genome. nonetheless extensive additional work needed spell steps better understand whether digital genetic code inevitable long term result cellularization transition must happen. future work paper proposed viewing life localized metastable chemical system avoids equilibration environment environmentally provided matter energy helps clarify origin early evolution life. conception points surfaces likely milieu self-propagating chemical systems originate suggests general tendency surfaceassociated systems complexify neighborhood selection lends credence idea cell habit expected innovation related dispersal implies particulate inheritance digital genetic coding likely innovations cellular life form arises evolves long enough. however verbal conceptual arguments tantalizing think reader agree need formalized fully. example work needed understand conditions conducive spontaneous emergence autocatalytic self-propagating chemical systems clarify systems move among multiple metastable equilibria competing states single surface interact surface associated states generate membranes cells. therefore hope space conception life stimulate generation mathematical models formally explore related question. nonetheless recognize many readers wish suspend acceptance framework rigorous quantitative models developed arguing lack formal demonstration discourage making conceptual framework guide empirical research. historically research origin life premised idea life cannot going exists entity capable self-replication. whether envisage first self-replicator protocell talented molecule perspective make pessimistic ever seeing spontaneous origin life consequently origin life research primarily focused historical problem explaining certain distinctive chemical features cellular life
