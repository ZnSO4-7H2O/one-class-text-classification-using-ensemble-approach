{"title": "Individual heterogeneity generates explosive system network dynamics", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Individual heterogeneity is a key characteristic of many real-world systems, from organisms to humans. However its role in determining the system's collective dynamics is typically not well understood. Here we study how individual heterogeneity impacts the system network dynamics by comparing linking mechanisms that favor similar or dissimilar individuals. We find that this heterogeneity-based evolution can drive explosive network behavior and dictates how a polarized population moves toward consensus. Our model shows good agreement with data from both biological and social science domains. We conclude that individual heterogeneity likely plays a key role in the collective development of real-world networks and communities, and cannot be ignored.
