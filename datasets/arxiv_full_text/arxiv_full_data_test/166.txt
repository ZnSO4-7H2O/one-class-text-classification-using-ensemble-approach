{"title": "Strain-dependent internal parameters in hyperelastic biological  materials", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The behavior of hyperelastic energies depending on an internal parameter, which is a function of the deformation gradient, is discussed. As an example, the analysis of two models where the parameter describes the activation of a tetanized skeletal muscle tissue is presented. In those models, the activation parameter depends on the strain and it is shown the importance of considering the derivative of the parameter with respect to the strain in order to capture the proper stress-strain relations.
