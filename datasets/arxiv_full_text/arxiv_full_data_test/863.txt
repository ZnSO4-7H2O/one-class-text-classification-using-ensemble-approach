{"title": "A neural model of the locust visual system for detection of object  approaches with real-world scenes", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In the central nervous systems of animals like pigeons and locusts, neurons were identified which signal objects approaching the animal on a direct collision course. Unraveling the neural circuitry for collision avoidance, and identifying the underlying computational principles, is promising for building vision-based neuromorphic architectures, which in the near future could find applications in cars or planes. At the present there is no published model available for robust detection of approaching objects under real-world conditions. Here we present a computational architecture for signalling impending collisions, based on known anatomical data of the locust \\emph{lobula giant movement detector} (LGMD) neuron. Our model shows robust performance even in adverse situations, such as with approaching low-contrast objects, or with highly textured and moving backgrounds. We furthermore discuss which components need to be added to our model to convert it into a full-fledged real-world-environment collision detector.

peaks relatively small increase towards collision event. on-lgmd response shows pronounced maximum collision time makes collision detection feasible situation. scene model shows distinct response peaks pedestrian enters scene. however lateral inhibition soon suppresses corresponding responses. since lateral inhibition cuts excitation means equation response suppression occurs inhibition

lgmd responses background movement cars passing etc. reﬂected response amplitudes comparatively small attenuated lateral inhibition. lobula giant movement detector present improvements respect
