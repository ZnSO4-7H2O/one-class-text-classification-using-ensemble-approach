{"title": "A Mathematical Model for Tumor Cell Population Dynamics Based on Target  Theory and Tumor Lifespan", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Radiation Therapy (XRT) is one of the most common cancer treatment methods. In this paper, a new mathematical model is proposed for the population dynamics of heterogeneous tumor cells following external beam radiation treatment. According to the Target Theory, the tumor population is divided into m different subpopulations based on the diverse effects of ionizing radiation on human cells. A hybrid model con- sists of a system of differential equations with random variable coefficients representing the transition rates between subpopulations is proposed. This model is utilized to sim- ulate the dynamics of cell subpopulations within a tumor. The model also describes the cell damage heterogeneity and the repair mechanism between two consecutive dose fractions. As such, a new definition of tumor lifespan based on population size is intro- duced. Finally, the stability of the system is studied by using the Gershgorin theorem. It is proven that the probability of target inactivity post radiation plays the most important role in the stability of the system.
