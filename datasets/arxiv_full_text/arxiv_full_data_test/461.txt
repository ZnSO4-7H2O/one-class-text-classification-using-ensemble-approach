We consider minimal models of stress granule formation based on the mechanism of phase separation regulated by ATP-driven chemical reactions. Motivated by experimental observations, we identify a minimal model of SG formation triggered by ATP depletion. Our analysis indicates that ATP is continuously hydrolysed to deter SG formation under normal conditions, and we provide specific predictions that can be tested experimentally.
