{"title": "A note on the duality between interaction responses and mutual positions  in flocking and schooling", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Background: Recent research in animal behaviour has contributed to determine how alignment, turning responses, and changes of speed mediate flocking and schooling interactions in different animal species. Here, we address specifically the problem of what interaction responses support different nearest neighbour configurations in terms of mutual position and distance. Results: We find that the different interaction rules observed in different animal species may be a simple consequence of the relative positions that individuals assume when they move together, and of the noise inherent with the movement of animals, or associated with tracking inaccuracy. Conclusions: The anisotropic positioning of individuals with respect to their neighbours, in combination with noise, can explain several aspects of the movement responses observed in real animal groups, and should be considered explicitly in future models of flocking and schooling. By making a distinction between interaction responses involved in maintaining a preferred flock configuration, and interaction responses directed at changing it, we provide a frame to discriminate movement interactions that signal directional conflict from those underlying consensual group motion.

group level patterns resemble least visually formed real animal groups. instance reynolds proposed model implements three diﬀerent rules. ﬁrst rule consists repulsion behaviour individual turns away local neighbours avoids local crowding collisions. second rule alignment behaviour turning response towards average heading local neighbours. actual situation individuals moving together three
