", "text": "abstract till biological sciences term transcription mainly refers transcription. recently published experimental findings obtained plasmodium falciparum strongly suggest existence transcription genome eukaryotic cells could shed light functions certain noncoding human eukaryotic genomes. introduction till biological sciences term transcription mainly refers transcription certain segment sequence genome copied either protein-coding functional non-protein-coding transcription mainly solves problem small fraction protein-coding genome works cannot solve problem large amounts non-protein-coding genome non-functional. many decades believed human genome composed noncoding functional thus named junk publication encyclopedia elements project claimed human genome biochemically functional immediately followed criticisms criteria used claim extremely loose recently published research results suggest human genome likely functional means large fraction human genome still thought useless. divergence opinions functions noncoding human genome arises probably fact main recently published research findings showed plasmodium falciparum could produce cell-cycleassociated amplified genomic-dna fragments intraerythrocytic cycle. cagfs thought single-stranded molecules might synthesized process transcription mechanism transcription exists eukaryotic cells problem related functions noncoding human eukaryotic genomes could least partially resolved. transcription hypothesis based published experimental findings hypothesize addition transcription mechanism transcription genome eukaryotic cells involves using polymerase copy particular segment noncoding sequence genome single-stranded molecule named ssdna transcript. ssdna transcripts molecules cagfs reported precious publication thus functions cagfs i.e. involved regulation gene expression cell cycle progression generating genetic alterations eukaryotic cells exposed prolonged environmental stress since sequence protein-coding transcribed called protein encoding gene sequence functional non-protein-coding transcribed called gene sequence functional non-protein-coding ssdna molecule transcribed therefore called gene. protein encoding gene’s gene’s point view large amounts noncoding human eukaryotic genomes useless gene’s point view large amounts noncoding could useful might harbour many unknown genes might required cell cycle regulation cellular stress responses recently published experimental findings showed falciparum could produce cagfs different points intraerythrocytic cycle chloroquine found induce production cagfs malaria parasite nature cagfs speculate cagfs ssdna molecules based following reasons. since cagfs amplified degraded cell cycle progression certainly incorporated genome released genome nucleoplasm. furthermore cagfs amplified cell cycle progression synthesis phase falciparum indicates unknown synthesis mechanism might exist outside phase cell cycle. unknown synthesis mechanism? semiconservative mode replication phase? answer certainly replication phase refers whole genome duplication even replication mechanism also works outside phase duplicate certain regions genome impossible release duplicated regions double-stranded fragments genome without affecting genome integrity. therefore reasonable postulate cagfs ssdna molecules might synthesized similar using polymerase instead polymerase process transcription. process could named transcription cagfs could thought ssdna transcripts. cagfs ssdna molecules transcribed noncoding genome nearly features cagfs genome-released multicopy-produced drug-inducible easily degraded cell cycle progression could reasonably explained. besides cagfs ssdna molecules transcribed noncoding genome role regulation gene expression cell cycle progression generating genetic alterations eukaryotic cells easily understandable bind complementary ssdna regions transcription sites. word discovery cagfs solid evidence support ideas experimental test hypothesis theoretically transcription exists eukaryotic cells possible isolate ssdna transcripts cells. since know specific sequence feature related ssdna transcripts therefore impossible develop protocol specifically isolate cells. besides ssdna nuclear samples might interfere isolation ssdna transcripts. reported ssdna accounts total nuclear isolated various eukaryotic cells hypothesized generated selective endogenous nuclease attacks early stage purification procedure. present simple practical approach proving existence ssdna transcripts eukaryotic cell cycle repeat arbitrarily-primed results using specific primers origin reported previous publication band produced primers called ub-related band previous publication representing fragment cagfs. process pcr-based approach outlined below. repeat previous experiments dose chloroquine needed treat falciparum isolates dose proved previous study best inducing cagfs. genomic isolates isolated time points following treatment subject using expected results consistent reported previous publication i.e. clear band found samples bigger band indicates amplified templates found h-isolated sample control groups isolates; cq-treated groups bigger band found isolated samples isolates isolated samples isolates. relative quantification bands measurement band density carried densitometer. order check ubrelated cagfs ssdna molecule nuclease used treat genomic samples performing experiments. bigger band described becomes smaller nuclease-treated groups looks nearly control groups means amplified ssdna templates degraded nuclease thus singlestrandedness ub-related cagfs confirmed. taken together ub-related cagfs proven single-stranded extragenomic cq-inducible amplified different points cell cycle definitely ssdna molecule produced transcription therefore hypothesis experimentally validated. study techniques could also used. northern blotting analysis could applied using product generated template preparing radioactive probe method useful could detect ub-related cagfs amplified could also show size ub-related cagfs. subcellular localization ub-related cagfs electron microscopy situ hybridization could used since falciparum genome sequencing project completed possible obtain whole sequence ub-related ssdna transcript checking related sequences within database. special sequence features whole ssdna transcript could found computer analysis candidate ssdna transcripts could picked genome database falciparum. experimental test candidate ssdna transcripts performed using primers designed according sequences candidate ssdna transcripts picked database. implications hypothesis importance hypothesis transcription fundamental mechanism eukaryotic cells involved wide-range cellular functions. date functions noncoding human eukaryotic genomes remain largely unknown hampered progress genome research. hypothesis proven true could least partially resolve perplexing problem hugely facilitate development biological life sciences. conclusion transcription might exist eukaryotic cells promising hypothesis proposed based discovery cell-cycle-associated amplified genomic-dna fragments falciparum. many reasons think cagfs ssdna molecules might produced exclusively transcription. existence transcription eukaryotic cells confirmed functions large amounts noncoding human eukaryotic genomes could least partially resolved. therefore experimental validation mechanism urgently needed. g.d. certain amplified genomic-dna
