{"title": "\"Social Laser\": Action Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Social  Energy", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The problem of the \"explanation\" of recent social explosions, especially in the Middle East, but also in Southern Europe and the USA, have been debated actively in the social and political literature. We can mention the contributions of P. Mason, F. Fukuyama, E. Schmidt and J. Cohen, I. Krastev to this debate. We point out that the diversity of opinions and conclusions is really amazing. At the moment, there is no consistent and commonly acceptable theory of these phenomena. We present a model of social explosions based on a novel approach for the description of social processes, namely, the quantum-like approach. Here quantum theory is treated simply as an operational formalism - without any direct relation to physics. We explore the quantum-like laser model to describe the possibility of Action Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Social Energy (ASE).

roughly speaking real political situation representation various sources information important. nowadays mass-media internet main sources discretization social energy. individual feels comfortable
