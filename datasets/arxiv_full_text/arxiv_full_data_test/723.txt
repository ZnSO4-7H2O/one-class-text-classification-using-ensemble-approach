{"title": "A brain signature highly predictive of future progression to Alzheimer's  dementia", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Early prognosis of Alzheimer's dementia is hard. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) typically precedes Alzheimer's dementia, yet only a fraction of MCI individuals will progress to dementia, even when screened using biomarkers. We propose here to identify a subset of individuals who share a common brain signature highly predictive of oncoming dementia. This signature was composed of brain atrophy and functional dysconnectivity and discovered using a machine learning model in patients suffering from dementia. The model recognized the same brain signature in MCI individuals, 90% of which progressed to dementia within three years. This result is a marked improvement on the state-of-the-art in prognostic precision, while the brain signature still identified 47% of all MCI progressors. We thus discovered a sizable MCI subpopulation which represents an excellent recruitment target for clinical trials at the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease.

alternative strategies investigated future e.g. training model directly progressor stable mci. limitation present study moderate sample size patients suﬀering mci. adni database large resting-state fmri added protocol later stages study adni adni. addition fmri acquired third participants even added protocol. early role synaptic dysfunction potential ability fmri capture dysfunction wanted build anatomo-functional diagnostic tool. choice limit sample size study since selected subjects needed imaging data modalities pass respective quality control assessment. even larger sample size another limitation adni dataset reﬂect diversity cases observed real-life clinical practice. participants particular screened exclude vascular dysfunction common comorbidity resources inclusive enrollment criteria help better assess generalizability biomarker-based diagnosis. direct application model population enrichment pharmaceutical clinical trials recruiting patients would normally progress dementia enrichment would increase eﬀect size drug reducing sample size needed demonstrate eﬃcacy therefore would also reduce cost trial. brain signature shared among dementia population common enough represent substantial portion participants interest alternative enrichment strategy geared towards generalizability would exclude subjects likely progress dementia. method thus brings closer precision medicine proposing middle ground traditional clinical cohorts entirely individual medicine. manuscript focused exclusively modalities. rationale non-invasive already widely used patient care elderly populations. beta amyloid imaging contrast expensive less available lumbar punctures invasive. nevertheless shown results combination multimodal factors help improve precision speciﬁcity sensitivity. since sensitivity modality abnormality vary across disease stages beneﬁcial combine obtain complementary information. therefore important future combination imaging blood tests targeting speciﬁc markers cognitive scores genetic factors lifestyle factors others help create stronger multiple would eﬀect increase sensitivity model earlier stages alzheimer’s disease. data collection sharing
