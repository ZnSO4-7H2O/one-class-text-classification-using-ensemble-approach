This involves, on the theory side, analyzing the dynamical systems arising from such networks. Which networks are, for instance, bistable? Which networks admit sustained oscillations? Which parameter values enable such behaviors? In this Perspective, we highlight recent progress in this area and point out some important future directions. Along the way, we summarize several techniques for analyzing general networks, such as eliminating variables to obtain steady-state parametrizations, and harnessing results on how incorporating intermediates affects dynamics.
