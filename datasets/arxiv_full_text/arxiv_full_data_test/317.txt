{"title": "Mutually cooperative epidemics on power-law networks", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The spread of an infectious disease can, in some cases, promote the propagation of other pathogens favouring violent outbreaks, which cause a discontinuous transition to an endemic state. The topology of the contact network plays a crucial role in these cooperative dynamics. We consider a susceptible--infected--removed (SIR) type model with two mutually cooperative pathogens: an individual already infected with one disease has an increased probability of getting infected by the other. We present an heterogeneous mean-field theoretical approach to the co--infection dynamics on generic uncorrelated power-law degree-distributed networks and validate its results by means of numerical simulations. We show that, when the second moment of the degree distribution is finite, the epidemic transition is continuous for low cooperativity, while it is discontinuous when cooperativity is sufficiently high. For scale-free networks, i.e. topologies with diverging second moment, the transition is instead always continuous. In this way we clarify the effect of heterogeneity and system size on the nature of the transition and we validate the physical interpretation about the origin of the discontinuity.

designing effective strategies prevent control them. traditional theories disease propagation ignore network effects large amount research past decades aimed understanding topological structure contact networks affects dynamics upon studies focused mainly dynamics single epidemic disease. issue growing interest current epidemiological research concurrent spreading diseases interact other. coupled spreading scenarios occur either multiple pathogens multiple strains disease simultaneously propagate population. complexity problem largely increased already two–pathogen case. diseases circulating host population interact many different ways either synergistic antagonistic effects. well known type interaction cross–immunity individual infected disease becomes partially fully immune infection second one. case pathogens compete population hosts. competition epidemics mutually exclusive antagonistic studied opposite case recently gaining attention spreading cooperating pathogens case individual already infected disease increased chance getting infected another. notable example spanish pandemic involved one–third world’s population killing tens millions people within months considerable proportion infected co–infected pneumonia deaths caused directly virus secondary bacterial infection. another well–known case increases host susceptibility pathogens particular hepatitis virus eases lead rapid outbreaks. interesting questions whether cooperation change epidemic transition continuous abrupt external conditions vary even slightly microscopic change infectivity. extremely relevant problem since possibility enact countermeasures critically depends type transition discontinuous case epidemic take population explosively without warning signs occur single
