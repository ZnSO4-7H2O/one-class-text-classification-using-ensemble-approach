{"title": "Mutations as Levy flights", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Data on single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large chromosomal rearrangements, coming from a long time evolution experiment with Escherichia Coli, are analyzed in order to argue that mutations along a cell lineage can be modeled as Levy flights in the mutation space. These Levy flights have two components: random single-base substitutions and large DNA rearrangements. From the data, we get estimations for the time rates of both events and the size distribution function of large rearrangements.
