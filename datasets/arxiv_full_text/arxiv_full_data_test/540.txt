{"title": "Local equilibrium in the Bak-Sneppen model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The Bak Sneppen (BS) model is a very simple model that exhibits all the richness of self-organized criticality theory. At the thermodynamic limit, the BS model converges to a situation where all particles have a fitness that is uniformly distributed between a critical value $p_c$ and 1. The $p_c$ value is unknown, as are the variables that influence and determine this value. Here, we study the Bak Sneppen model in the case in which the lowest fitness particle interacts with an arbitrary even number of $m$ nearest neighbors. We show that $p_{c,m}$ verifies a simple local equilibrium relationship. Based on this relationship, we can determine bounds for $p_{c,m}$.
