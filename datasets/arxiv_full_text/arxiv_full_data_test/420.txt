{"title": "Mesoscopic Modeling of Random Walk and Reactions in Crowded Media", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We develop a mesoscopic modeling framework for diffusion in a crowded environment, particularly targeting applications in the modeling of living cells. Through homogenization techniques we effectively coarse-grain a detailed microscopic description into a previously developed internal state diffusive framework. The observables in the mesoscopic model correspond to solutions of macroscopic partial differential equations driven by stochastically varying diffusion fields in space and time. Analytical solutions and numerical experiments illustrate the framework.
