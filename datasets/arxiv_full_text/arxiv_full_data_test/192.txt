{"title": "Therapeutic target discovery using Boolean network attractors:  improvements of kali", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In a previous article, an algorithm for identifying therapeutic targets in Boolean networks modeling pathological mechanisms was introduced. In the present article, the improvements made on this algorithm, named kali, are described. These improvements are i) the possibility to work on asynchronous Boolean networks, ii) a finer assessment of therapeutic targets and iii) the possibility to use multivalued logic. kali assumes that the attractors of a dynamical system, such as a Boolean network, are associated with the phenotypes of the modeled biological system. Given a logic-based model of pathological mechanisms, kali searches for therapeutic targets able to reduce the reachability of the attractors associated with pathological phenotypes, thus reducing their likeliness. kali is illustrated on an example network and used on a biological case study. The case study is a published logic-based model of bladder tumorigenesis from which kali returns consistent results. However, like any computational tool, kali can predict but can not replace human expertise: it is a supporting tool for coping with the complexity of biological systems in the field of drug discovery.

potential bullets could assessed estimating ability reducing size pathological basins namely basins pathological attractors. criterion permissive since therapeutic bullets longer necessarily remove pathological attractors. reducing size pathological basin renders corresponding pathological attractor less reachable associated pathological phenotype less likely. criterion includes previous removing attractor means reducing basin empty set. consequently therapeutic bullets obtainable previous criterion still obtainable. main limitations boolean models variables take values simplistic

moreover example network none found therapeutic bullets allow recovery physiological attractors golden bullets seem idealistic golden pills. results presented article obtained laptop intel core

scientiﬁc community might better realistic synchrony discussed introduction section page consequently computational tool aimed working models built scientiﬁc community kali handle updating scheme. also note asynchronous updating scheme. implemented kali popular named general asynchronous updating randomly selected variable updated iteration. however asynchronous updating methods exist. example random order updating variables updated iteration along randomly selected order. implementing various asynchronous updating schemes kali could required future improvement. kali uses criterion assessing therapeutic bullets. criterion brings wider range targeting strategies intended push pathological behaviors toward physiological ones. based permissive assumption stating reducing reachability pathological attractors therapeutic. silico tool kali little permissive important since ﬁndings obtained simulations outlive bottleneck separating predictions reality. strict assessment therapeutic bullets risk highlighting candidate targets miss interesting ones high. moreover predicted necessarily mean true prediction apparently poor interest reveal great interest vice versa. criterion also brings ﬁner assessment therapeutic bullets since possible increases bphysioi stest considered. previous criterion therapeutic potential bphysioi stest thus reducing assessment bullets therapeutic not. things dichotomous rather nuanced assessment therapeutic bullets nuanced too. kali work multivalued logic. allowing variables take arbitrary ﬁnite number values enable accurately model biological processes produce ﬁne-tuned therapeutic bullets. however accuracy ﬁne-tuning cost increased computational requirement. indeed size state space depends size model used logic. consequently size model used logic balanced smaller model variables ﬁnely valued. example accurate therapeutic investigation model contain essential speciﬁc pieces studied pathological mechanisms modeled ﬁnely valued logic. hand broad therapeutic investigation exhaustive model used modeled coarse-grained logic. note ultimate multivalued logic inﬁnitely valued fuzzy logic fuzzy logic whole interval real numbers used valuate variables might bring best accuracy qualitative modeling formalism however using continuous logic implies leave relatively convenient discrete paradigm enter continuous kali also demonstrates able predicting therapeutic bullets consistent underlaying model biological knowledge experimental evidences. example bladder tumorigensis case study kali returned therapeutic bullets inhibiting pik/akt pathway cdca tyrosine phosphatase documented targets cancer therapies. even surprising therapeutic bullets suggests stimulate growth factor receptor promoting growth arrest consistent underlaying model. indeed according model appears founded negative crosstalk fgfr egfr thus indirectly inhibiting growth factor receptor egfr also documented target cancer therapies. additional improvements envisioned kali. ﬁrst allow therapeutic bullets create attractors namely novo attractors. conceivable bullet greatly decrease pathological basins creating attractor belonging physiological variant pathological one. novo attractor currently tagged kali physiological pathological thus rejecting concerned bullet. however novo attractor weakly pathological induced bullet greatly decreasing basin heavier pathological attractors case retained. second envisioned improvement allow partial matching checking attractor associated physiological phenotype comparing physiological attractors. currently attractor match physiological attractor considered pathologic. however conceivable variables exhibiting physiological behavior attractor pathologically impact associated phenotype. allow case considered variables within attractors allowed matched assessing associated phenotype. suggests concept decisive variables namely variables whose behavior attractors suﬃcient biologically interpret associated phenotypes. elisabeth remy colleagues already implemented distinction model bladder tumorigenesis used present article case study decisive variables belonging equations three output phenotypes. therefore kali could allow non-decisive variables matched. ultimately could allow modeler specify himself/herself physiological attractor without consider physiological pathological variant. could also allow longer think terms physiological versus pathological attractors desirable ones. moreover implementing second envisioned improvement could greatly facilitate implementation ﬁrst since goal would become obtain desired attractors regardless novo not. network directed graph containing nodes network containing edges linking nodes. practice nodes

additional attractors coming multivalued logic. indeed given zadeh operators also work boolean logic boolean results still obtainable. apply pathological attractors flocker patho diﬀers boolean multivalued cases. example aphysio indicates instruction sent energy partly supplied. consequently locker partly activated resulting partial inhibition activator. task thus moderately performed despite full instruction hence coping moderate energy supply. concerning pathological attractors example apatho indicates instruction sent absence energy supply. consequently locker fully activated prevent task. however pathological defects locker partly activated. task performed absence energy. however since locker partly operational task performed maximum rate maybe limiting pathological consequences. among pathological attractors apatho considered weakly pathological. indeed apatho locker fully activated since energy. however instruction therefore task stop. hand apatho apatho pathological since task performed energy available. suppresses pathological attractors maintaining three physiological attractors allowing pathological variant properly respond three possible levels
