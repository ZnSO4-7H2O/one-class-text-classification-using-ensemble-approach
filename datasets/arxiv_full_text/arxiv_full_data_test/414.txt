{"title": "All-atom simulations reveal how single point mutations promote serpin  misfolding", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Protein misfolding is implicated in many diseases, including the serpinopathies. For the canonical inhibitory serpin {\\alpha}1-antitrypsin (A1AT), mutations can result in protein deficiencies leading to lung disease, and misfolded mutants can accumulate in hepatocytes leading to liver disease. Using all-atom simulations based on the recently developed Bias Functional algorithm we elucidate how wild-type A1AT folds and how the disease-associated S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) mutations lead to misfolding. The deleterious Z mutation disrupts folding at an early stage, while the relatively benign S mutant shows late stage minor misfolding. A number of suppressor mutations ameliorate the effects of the Z mutation and simulations on these mutants help to elucidate the relative roles of steric clashes and electrostatic interactions in Z misfolding. These results demonstrate a striking correlation between atomistic events and disease severity and shine light on the mechanisms driving chains away from their correct folding routes.
