{"title": "Reducing the extinction risk of stochastic populations via  non-demographic noise", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We consider non-demographic noise in the form of uncertainty in the reaction step size, and reveal a dramatic effect this noise may have on the stability of self-regulating populations. Employing the reaction scheme mA->kA, but allowing, e.g., the product number k to be a-priori unknown and sampled from a given distribution, we show that such non-demographic noise can greatly reduce the population's extinction risk compared to the fixed k case. Our analysis is tested against numerical simulations, and by using empirical data of different species, we argue that certain distributions may be more evolutionary beneficial than others.
