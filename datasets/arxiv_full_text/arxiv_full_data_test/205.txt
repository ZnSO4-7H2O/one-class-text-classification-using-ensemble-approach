{"title": "Paradoxes in Leaky Microbial Trade", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Microbes produce metabolic resources that are important for cell growth yet leak across membranes into the extracellular environment. Other microbes in the same environment can use these resources and adjust their own metabolic production accordingly---causing other resources to leak into the environment. The combined effect of these processes is an economy in which organismal growth and metabolic production are coupled to others in the community. We propose a model for the co-evolving dynamics of metabolite concentrations, production regulation, and population frequencies for the case of two cell types, each requiring and capable of producing two metabolites. In this model, beneficial trade relations emerge without any coordination, via individual-level production decisions that maximize each cell's growth rate given its perceived environment. As we vary production parameters of the model, we encounter three paradoxical behaviors, where a change that should intuitively benefit some cell type, actually harms it. (1) If a cell type is more efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite and becomes even more efficient, its frequency in the population can decrease. (2) If a cell type is less efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite but becomes less inefficient, the growth rate of the population can decrease. (3) Finally, if a cell type controls its counterpart's production decisions so as to maximize its own growth rate, the ultimate growth rate it achieves can be lower than if the two cell types each maximized their own growth. These three paradoxes highlight the complex and counter-intuitive dynamics that emerge in simple microbial economies.

rather emerges cell type producing maximizes growth rate. investigated primarily conditions permit coexistence. however consider also resulting population composition growth rates interplay three types dynamic variables model lead seemingly paradoxical phenomena. illustrate three salient examples below. figure curse increased efﬁciency. relative frequency type cells growth rate total population shown function efﬁciency type cells producing metabolite efﬁciency type cells increases relative frequency ultimately decreases. population growth rate however increases higher metabolic efﬁciency. shaded regions indicate type cell populations increasing decreasing relative frequency improve efﬁciency producing metabolite i.e. moving left right along indicated line. dark gray region relative frequency cell type decreases towards efﬁciency increases towards inﬁnity. paradox curse increased efﬁciency ﬁrst paradox concerns relative frequency cells type function metabolite production efﬁciency. speciﬁcally consider horizontal cross section parameter space figure ﬁxed varies. cells type become better better producing relative frequency ﬁrst increases might expected increased productivity. however point relative frequency reaches maximum declines thus even though type cells produce metabolite without decreasing production represent smaller fraction population. effect intensiﬁes production efﬁciency increases toward inﬁnity driving fraction type cells population towards region curse effect illustrated figure occurs area cell type completely specialized makes metabolite. since cells need grow cell type specializes enough environment provided cell type forego production along horizontal cross section following arrows figure cell type gets efﬁcient producing cell type production capacity type cells getting better producing fraction population—needed support continued growth populations—increases. phenomenon seen analytically limit small degradation rate assumption full specialization case fraction type cells inversely proportionate efﬁciency producing though relative frequency type cells increases decreases increases population growth rate always increasing. therefore even relative frequency cell type decreasing total numbers might decreasing growing faster rate would otherwise. local effects—decreased relative frequency cell type —are paradoxical global effects—the population growth rate—are consistent expectations. observation partially resolves paradox wherein cell type population appears suffer result gain efﬁciency. however next paradox show even considering growth rate instead relative frequency population suffer result gain efﬁciency. figure curse decreased inefﬁciency. growth rate type cells isolation increases improve efﬁciency making metabolite produces poorly similar previous plot presence reference cell type here type cells increase efﬁciency producing population growth rate decreases light gray region. also corresponds increase frequency type cell shaded regions indicate population growth rate constant decreasing increasing type cells improve efﬁciency producing metabolite i.e. moving along

correspond increased growth rate however mixed population figure shows cells type efﬁcient producing metabolite population growth rate decreases thus despite increased capacity produce metabolites population grows slowly. explain paradox consider absolute maximum growth rate population cell types could achieve assuming perfectly coordinated production metabolites. maximum growth rate sustainable growth rates cell types must equal otherwise relative frequency cell types change population longer able sustain growth rate. reason maximum sustainable growth rate achieved nash
