In the model, we consider the proliferation of uninfected CD4+ T cells by a logistic function and the infected CD4+ T cells are assumed to have an infection-age structure. Our main results concern the Hopf bifurcation of the model by using the theory of integrated semigroup and the Hopf bifurcation theory for semilinear equations with nondense domain. Bifurcation analysis indicates that there exist some parameter values such that this HIV infection model has a non-trivial periodic solution which bifurcates from the positive equilibrium. The numerical simulations are also carried out.
