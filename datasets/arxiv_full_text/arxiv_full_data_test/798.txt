{"title": "Emergent memory in cell signaling: Persistent adaptive dynamics in  cascades can arise from the diversity of relaxation time-scales", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, an evolutionarily conserved motif present in all eukaryotic cells, is involved in coordinating critical cell-fate decisions, regulating protein synthesis, and mediating learning and memory. While the steady-state behavior of the pathway stimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show using a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient adaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the response is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as amplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales much longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes, exhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated MAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity suggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant duration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or cross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying this behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the different cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between different layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases as enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to one or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent adaptive response reported here, indicative of a cellular \"short-term\" memory, suggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway plays an even more central role in information processing by eukaryotic cells.
