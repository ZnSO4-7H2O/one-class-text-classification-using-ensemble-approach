{"title": "Porous translucent electrodes enhance current generation from  photosynthetic biofilms", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We tested the enhancement of electrical current generated from photosynthetically active bacteria by use of electrodes with porosity on the nano- and micrometer length-scale. For two cyanobacteria on structured indium-tin-oxide electrodes, current generation was increased by two orders of magnitude and the photo-response was substantially faster compared to non-porous anodes. These properties highlight porosity as an important design strategy for electrochemical bio-interfaces. The role of porosity on different length scales was studied systematically which revealed that the main performance enhancement was caused by the increased surface area of the electrodes. More complex microstructured architectures which spanned biofilms as translucent 3D scaffolds provided additional advantage in the presence of microbial direct electron transfer (DET). The absence of a clear DET contribution in both studied cyanobacteria, Synechocystis and Nostoc, raises questions about the role of conductive cellular components previously found in both organisms.
