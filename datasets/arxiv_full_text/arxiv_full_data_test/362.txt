{"title": "Coevolution Maintains Diversity in the Stochastic \"Kill the Winner\"  Model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The \"Kill the Winner\" hypothesis is an attempt to address the problem of diversity in biology. It argues that host-specific predators control the population of each prey, preventing a winner from emerging and thus maintaining the coexistence of all species in the system. We develop a stochastic model for the \"Kill the Winner\" paradigm and show that the stable coexistence state of the deterministic \"Kill the Winner\" model is destroyed by demographic stochasticity, through a cascade of extinction events. We formulate an individual-level stochastic model in which predator-prey coevolution promotes high diversity of the ecosystem by generating a persistent population flux of species.
