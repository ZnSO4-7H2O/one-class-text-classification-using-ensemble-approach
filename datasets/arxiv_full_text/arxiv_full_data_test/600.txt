However, its role in pulses generated in biomolecular contexts is generally unclear.

We find that non-normality is present in standard models of feedforward loops. We used a generalized framework and pseudospectrum analysis to identify non-normality in larger biomolecular circuit models, finding that it correlates well with pulsing dynamics.
