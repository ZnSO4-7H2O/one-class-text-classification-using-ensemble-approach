{"title": "Scalar Reduction of a Neural Field Model with Spike Frequency Adaptation", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We study a deterministic version of a one- and two-dimensional attractor neural network model of hippocampal activity first studied by Itskov et al 2011. We analyze the dynamics of the system on the ring and torus domain with an even periodized weight matrix, assum- ing weak and slow spike frequency adaptation and a weak stationary input current. On these domains, we find transitions from spatially localized stationary solutions (\"bumps\") to (periodically modulated) solutions (\"sloshers\"), as well as constant and non-constant velocity traveling bumps depending on the relative strength of external input current and adaptation. The weak and slow adaptation allows for a reduction of the system from a distributed partial integro-differential equation to a system of scalar Volterra integro-differential equations describing the movement of the centroid of the bump solution. Using this reduction, we show that on both domains, sloshing solutions arise through an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and derive a normal form for the Hopf bifurcation on the ring. We also show existence and stability of constant velocity solutions on both domains using Evans functions. In contrast to existing studies, we assume a general weight matrix of Mexican-hat type in addition to a smooth firing rate function.
