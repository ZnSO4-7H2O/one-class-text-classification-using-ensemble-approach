{"title": "Theoretical Model and Characteristics of Mitochondrial Thermogenesis", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Mitochondria of brown adipocyte (BA) are the main intracellular sites for thermogenesis, which have been targeted for therapy to reduce obesity. However, there are long-standing critique and debates about the ability of raising cellular temperature by endogenous thermogenesis. Currently, the wrong theoretical model gave about the five orders of magnitude less than facts. Here, based on the first law of thermodynamics and thermal diffusion equation, the deduced theoretical model of mitochondrial thermogenesis satisfies Laplace equation, and is a special case for thermal diffusion equation. The model settles the long-standing questioning about the ability of raising cellular temperature by endogenous thermogenesis, and explains the thermogenic characteristics of brown adipocyte. The model and calculations also suggest that the number of free available proton is the major limiting factor for endogenous thermogenesis and its speed.
