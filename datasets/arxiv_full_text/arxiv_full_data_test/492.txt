From these pattern-making abilities, we may draw inspiration for digital visual art. A simple mathematical model is proposed and an algorithm is designed that may create such sand-bubbler patterns artificially. In addition, design parameters to modify the patterns are identified and analyzed by computational aesthetic measures. Finally, an extension of the algorithm is discussed that may enable controlling and guiding generative evolution of the art-making process.

dwell tropical sandy beaches across indo–paciﬁc region. permanently inhabit intertidal environments adapted interplay high tide. sand–bubblers surface deposit feeders. thus habitat must periodically covered water food supply restore. also air–breathers. thus habital zone needs periodically uncovered water giving time feeding. observing periodic changes crabs burrows sand seek shelter hide high

particles scraped subsequently ingested. crab feeds upper millimeter sand. residual larger nutrient–deﬁcient sand grains molded ball–like globules digested motivates calling pseudo–faecal pellets. pellet reached certain diameter scales size crab moved along body pushed away behind animal. moving along straight line radiating burrow ejecting pellets certain distance crab steps aside turns around

lastly crab interrupt feeding even evident external trigger instance rest restore water supply done burrow. exact position pellet follows structure burrow–oriented feeding behavior subject substantial
