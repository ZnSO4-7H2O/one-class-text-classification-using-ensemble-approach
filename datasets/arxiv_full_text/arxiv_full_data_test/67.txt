{"title": "A hydrodynamic limit for chemotaxis in a given heterogeneous environment", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In this paper the first equation within a class of well known chemotaxis systems is derived as a hydrodynamic limit from a stochastic interacting many particle system on the lattice. The cells are assumed to interact with attractive chemical molecules on a finite number of lattice sites, but they only directly interact among themselves on the same lattice site. The chemical environment is assumed to be stationary with a slowly varying mean, which results in a non-trivial macroscopic chemotaxis equation for the cells. Methodologically the limiting procedure and its proofs are based on results by Koukkus [18] and Kipnis/Landim [17]. Numerical simulations extend and illustrate the theoretical findings.
