{"title": "Universal geometric constraints during epithelial jamming", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " As an injury heals, an embryo develops, or a carcinoma spreads, epithelial cells systematically change their shape. In each of these processes cell shape is studied extensively, whereas variation of shape from cell-to-cell is dismissed most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and variation of cell shape come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variation are mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That relationship is shown to govern maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from both non-asthmatic and asthmatic donors as well as formation of the ventral furrow in the epithelial monolayer of the Drosophila embryo in vivo. Across these and other vastly different epithelial systems, cell shape variation collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all and potentially universal. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for quantitatively by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings thus uncover a connection between jamming and geometry that is generic -spanning jammed living and inert systems alike- and demonstrate that proximity of the cell layer to the jammed state is the principal determinant of the most primitive features of epithelial cell shape and shape variation.
