{"title": "Gap junction plasticity as a mechanism to regulate network-wide  oscillations", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap-junctional coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.

oscillate frequency high number shared gjs. phase diﬀerences stay mostly out-of-phase. correlation except particular case ∆fres number shared high show correlation. oscillation power. comparing panel observe oscillation power seems match networks mostly oscillation power increasing sn’s levels oscillation frequency. comparing panel observe extension region oscillate frequency. phase diﬀerences observe large region in-phase. correlation comparing panel observe large extension region networks synchronized. figure junction coupling allows networks transmit information junction plasticity improves robustness transfer. light blue output-network purple networks share despite directly receiving input signal synchronizes activity panels networks share gjs. data represented. following
