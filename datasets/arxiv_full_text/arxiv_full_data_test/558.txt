{"title": "De novo construction of polyploid linkage maps using discrete graphical  models", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Linkage maps are used to identify the location of genes responsible for traits and diseases. New sequencing techniques have created opportunities to substantially increase the density of genetic markers. Such revolutionary advances in technology have given rise to new challenges, such as creating high-density linkage maps. Current multiple testing approaches based on pairwise recombination fractions are underpowered in the high-dimensional setting and do not extend easily to polyploid species. We propose to construct linkage maps using graphical models either via a sparse Gaussian copula or a nonparanormal skeptic approach. Linkage groups (LGs), typically chromosomes, and the order of markers in each LG are determined by inferring the conditional independence relationships among large numbers of markers in the genome. Through simulations, we illustrate the utility of our map construction method and compare its performance with other available methods, both when the data are clean and contain no missing observations and when data contain genotyping errors and are incomplete. We apply the proposed method to two genotype datasets: barley and potato from diploid and polypoid populations, respectively. Our comprehensive map construction method makes full use of the dosage SNP data to reconstruct linkage map for any bi-parental diploid and polyploid species. We have implemented the method in the R package netgwas.

diploids polyploids genotype q-ploid organism homozygous heterozygous single locus genome. diﬀerent genotype forms gene called alleles. alleles lead diﬀerent traits. alleles commonly represented letters; example gene related trait allele could called q-ploid individuals copies allele. allele copies organism identical organism homozygous state locus; otherwise heterozygous state. instance tetraploid individual homozygous size alleles allele copies either correspond genotypes aaaa aaaa respectively. tetraploid individual heterozygous following three genotypes would appear copy allele three copies copies copies three copies copy unlike existing methods method works diploid organisms also polyploids. obviously method also used analyze simple haploid organisms haploid yeast cells. mating parental lines recent common biological ancestors called inbreeding. mating parental lines common ancestors e.g. generations called outcrossing. cases genomes derived progenies random mosaics genomes parents. consequence inbreeding parental alleles attributable parental line genome progeny whereas outcrossing case. inbreeding progenies derive homozygous parents. inbreeding designs backcrossing lead homozygous population derived genotype data include homozygous genotypes parents namely however inbreeding designs lead heterozygous population derived genotype data contain heterozygous homozygous genotypes namely although many experimental designs used genetic studies existing methods linkage mapping support inbreeding experimental designs. however proposed algorithm constructs linkage type biparental inbreeding experimental designs. fact unlike existing methods approach require specifying population type broad handles population type contains least distinct genotype states. outcrossing outbred experimental designs full–sib families derive non–homozygous parents. thus genome progenies includes mixed many diﬀerent marker types including fully informative markers partially informative markers markers called fully informative resulting gamete types phenotypically distinguished basis genotypes; called partially informative gamete types identical

genotype state chromosomal region locus oﬀspring either homozygous maternal heterozygous homozygous paternal. instance result genetic linkage crossover homozygous maternal genotype typically followed heterozygous genotype able followed homozygous paternal genotype. genetic linkage means markers located close another chromosome linked tend inherited together meiosis. another biological fact meiosis markers diﬀerent chromosomes segregate independently; called independent assortment law. scheme occurs inbred homozygous populations include genotype states namely homozygous maternal homozygous paternal. mapping populations backcrossing included scheme. then assumption crossover interference meaning crossover formed crossovers prevented forming recombination frequency locations independent recombination locations genome. following holds property neighboring markers construct linkage maps using conditional dependence models. figure shows cartoon image conditional dependencies scheme. possible genotype tetraploid species includes copy desirable allele represent alleles ﬁrst second third fourth homologues respectively. possible genotypes include copy desired allele aaaa aaaa aaaa. typically impossible distinguish genotypes number copies desired allele therefore take random variable observed number alleles location genetic linkage sequence ordered markers forms markov chain

furthermore polyploids linkage depends single chromosome pairs meiosis generate gametes. regard polyploid parents allele haploids oﬀspring also co-vary neighboring markers. possibility diﬀerent pairing models meiosis makes situation complex. diploids homologue chromosomes pair form bivalent cross-over recombinations occur. polyploid meiosis occur various ways; tetraploids four homologue chromosomes meiosis form either separate bivalents contributes haploid like diploids alternatively complex situation four homologue chromosomes form quadrivalents cross-over occurs eight haploids. pairing models bivalent quadrivalent crossover events result recombined haploids mosaics parental chromosomes. outbred progenies genetically diverse highly heterozygous whereas inbred individuals little genetic variation. population mixed diﬀerent marker types conditional independence relationship neighboring markers complicated. many genetic assumptions made traditional linkage analyses hold
