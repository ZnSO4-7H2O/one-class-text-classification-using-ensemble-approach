{"title": "The recovery of a recessive allele in a Mendelian diploid model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We study the large population limit of a stochastic individual-based model which describes the time evolution of a diploid hermaphroditic population reproducing according to Mendelian rules. In [Neukirch, Bovier, 2016] it is proved that sexual reproduction allows unfit alleles to survive in individuals with mixed genotype much longer than they would in populations reproducing asexually. In the present paper we prove that this indeed opens the possibility that individuals with a pure genotype can reinvade in the population after the appearance of further mutations. We thus expose a formal description of a mechanism by which a recessive allele can re-emerge in a population. This can be seen as a statement of genetic robustness exhibited by diploid populations performing sexual reproduction.
