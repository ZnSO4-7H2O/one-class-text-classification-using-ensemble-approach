{"title": "Structural Bifurcation Analysis in Chemical Reaction Networks", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In living cells, chemical reactions form a complex network. Complicated dynamics arising from such networks are the origins of biological functions. We propose a novel mathematical method to analyze bifurcation behaviors of a reaction system from the network structure alone. The whole network is decomposed into subnetworks based on \"buffering structures\". For each subnetwork, the bifurcation condition is studied independently, and the parameters that can induce bifurcations and the chemicals that can exhibit bifurcations are determined. We demonstrate our theory using hypothetical and real networks.
