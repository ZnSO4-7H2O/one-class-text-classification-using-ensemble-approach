{"title": "A geometric model of multi-scale orientation preference maps via Gabor  functions", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In this paper we present a new model for the generation of orientation preference maps in the primary visual cortex (V1), considering both orientation and scale features. First we undertake to model the functional architecture of V1 by interpreting it as a principal fiber bundle over the 2-dimensional retinal plane by introducing intrinsic variables orientation and scale. The intrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and the set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor function derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted in a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position, orientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor functions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the orientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the 2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the reducible representation of the $\\text{SE}(2)=\\mathbb{R}^2\\times S^1$ group. A comparison will be provided with a previous model based on the Bargman transform in the irreducible representation of the $\\text{SE}(2)$ group, outlining that the new model is more physiologically motivated. Then we present simulation results related to the construction of the orientation preference map by using Gabor filters with different scales and compare those results to the relevant neurophysiological findings in the literature.
