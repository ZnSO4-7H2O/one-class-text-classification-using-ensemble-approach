{"title": "Geometric Analysis of Synchronization in Neuronal Networks with Global  Inhibition and Coupling Delays", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We study synaptically coupled neuronal networks to identify the role of coupling delays in network's synchronized behaviors. We consider a network of excitable, relaxation oscillator neurons where two distinct populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory, are coupled and interact with each other. The excitatory population is uncoupled, while the inhibitory population is tightly coupled. A geometric singular perturbation analysis yields existence and stability conditions for synchronization states under different firing patterns between the two populations, along with formulas for the periods of such synchronous solutions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of coupling delays in the network promotes synchronization. Numerical simulations are conducted to supplement and validate analytical results. We show the results carry over to a model for spindle sleep rhythms in thalamocortical networks, one of the biological systems which motivated our study. The analysis helps to explain how coupling delays in either excitatory or inhibitory synapses contribute to producing synchronized rhythms.

cubic inhibition eﬀectively turns e-cells right knee. ﬁrst possible trajectory e-cells given fig. inhibition turns e-cells jump adjacent right branch cubic evolves right branch stot cubic. e-cells right knee hand turning inhibition makes immediately jump left branch branch. regardless location e-cells however cases lead result e-cells jump j-cell assume j-cell longer active phase e-cells. condition implies that e-cells still travel right branch cubic corresponding ﬁrst case mentioned above e-cells reach right knee fig. j-cell reaches right knee stot curve. thus time jumps left branch labeled left branch cubic lies right knee stot cubic. time delay excitatory synapses turn-oﬀ excitation j-cell follow immediately. depending size time delay compared remaining time active phase following three cases whose trajectories j-cell given fig. fig. j-cell still lies right knee stot curve time labeled fig. j-cell ﬁrst jumps point along stot cubic. then j-cell moves right branch stot cubic moves left branch cubic. j-cell reaches right knee jumps point left branch stot cubic; j-cell lies right knee stot cubic time jumps j-cell would immediately jump left branch stot cubic shown fig. iii) j-cell reaches right knee stot cubic within time window jump down j-cell ﬁrst jumps left branch stot moves upwards turn-oﬀ excitation becomes eﬀective. happens j-cell jumps left branch stot cubic starts move upwards shown fig. note that regardless location j-cell along right branch stot cubic time j-cell eventually reaches left branch stot cubic travels upwards along left branch cubic. inhibition e-cells starts turn however time delay inhibition turn-oﬀ occur immediately. means e-cells jump left branch cubic continue move cubic instead. moreover suﬃciently large inhibitory delay e-cells able reach point left knee cubic jump right branch cubic ﬁnally released inhibition. e-cells jump delay turn-on excitation becomes eﬀective. however even suﬃciently large j-cell lies left knee stot cubic excitation turns therefore also jumps right branch stot cubic returns starting point existence synchronous solution requires e-cells reach point left knee cubic escape silent phase inhibition j-cell turns despite fact cell excitatory. rubin terman showed indeed case exists additional slow variable governs rate synaptic coupling term however model include additional equation corresponding rate; synaptic eﬀect modeled direct function corresponding x-variables. demonstrate existence time delay synapses replaces additional slow variable needed existence synchronized oscillations e-cells. rubin terman showed lower bound duration jcell active phase synchronous solution exist give similar estimates bound. singular synchronous solution exists e-cells region inhibition turns time. follow active phase j-cell suﬃciently long suﬃciently large. recall y-value left knee cubic. τesc denote time increase slow subsystem. denote duration j-cell active phase. synchronous oscillatory solution exist τesc less time e-cells jump silent phase e-cells released inhibition i.e. duration e-cell silent phase even though three possible cases position j-cell e-cells jump identiﬁed above show cases result lower bound case j-cell still lies right knee stot cubic e-cells jump delay time consists four diﬀerent parts ﬁrst part corresponds time delay jumped next part corresponds time denoted needed e-cell reach right knee cubic jumping adjacent cubic jumps down spends time jumping right branch stot cubic ﬁnally time denoted needed reach right knee stot cubic. combining times yields similarly consists three parts time e-cells jump j-cell feel excitation turn above delay j-cell jumps cell feels turn-oﬀ inhibition. thus singular solution exists τesc replacing right hand side inequality using equation rearranging terms follows τesc case j-cell lies right knee stot cubic excitation turns case j-cell immediately jumps silent phase. implies expressions case lower bound τesc case j-cell reaches right knee stot cubic delay time break parts corresponding time needed reach right knee corresponding time needed travel along left branch stot cubic jumping down. then e-cells spend time silent phase part note thus implies lower bound stability. show stability synchronous solution suppose perturb system starting positions e-cells slightly diﬀerent active phase. since y-nullcline monotone decreasing curve intersects x-nullcline left branch shown fig. function negative y-nullcline magnitude increases moves right branch x-nullcline. implies speed yi-variable decreases moves along right branch becomes closer y-nullcline. thus cell behind moves faster distance cells decreases move active phase. active phase j-cell suﬃciently long delay suﬃciently large e-cells jump left branch cell. cells jump time relative positions reversed distance preserved. cell front reaches right knee nullcline inhibition still jumps left branch nullcline move rapidly lagging cell distance increase. however second cell jumps either reaching right knee nullcline inhibition turning cells branch. case left branch nullcline inhibition turns right branch velocity direction decreases e-cells move along left branch nullcline. active phase j-cell suﬃciently long delay suﬃciently large e-cells able reach point left knee cubic inhibition turns thus jump active phase simultaneously. take perturbation cells suﬃciently small compression trajectories diﬀerence velocity along either branch compensate expansion jumps. rubin terman noted domain attraction synchronous

excitation escapes follows period synchronous solution silent phase. simply determined dynamics j-cell determined e-cells. remark noted proof theorem above presence delay inhibition suﬃcient condition existence synchronized solution assume populations overlapping active phases. however could omit delay obtain results. suppose delay e-cells j-cell lies right knee stot cubic e-cells jump left branch

theorem assume active phases populations overlap. order synchronous solution exist without delay inhibition need assume opposite. ecells active phase j-cell silent phase vice versa. then synchronous

suﬃciently long delay excitation also enables e-cells move reach point labeled right knee cubic j-cell jumps follows immediately jumps left branch cubic labeled inhibitory delay time j-cell jumps left

active phase e-cell suﬃciently long j-cell reaches right knee stot cubic e-cell reaches respective right knee. makes j-cell jump left branch stot cubic labeled also suﬃciently large possible j-cell

allows e-cells reach point left knee cubic jump ﬁnally released inhibition. e-cells jump right branch cubic again. time j-cell reaches point left knee stot cubic jumps starting point thus full cycle synchronous solution complete. remark noted hypotheses above delay large enough suﬃcient condition existence synchronized solution assume populations overlapping active phases. however could omit

synchronous solution exist case requires diﬀerent condition positions populations similar corollary need populations start diﬀerent phases example e-cells active j-cell silent phase. then synchronous

j-cell jumps right branch stot cubic e-cells immediately receive inhibition. shown corollary large e-cells right knee cubic j-cell jumps thus immediately jump left branch cubic. situation repeats
