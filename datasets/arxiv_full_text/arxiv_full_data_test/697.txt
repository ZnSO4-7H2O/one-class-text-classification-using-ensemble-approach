{"title": "Concurrent interactive visualization and handling of molecular  structures over the Internet in web browsers", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " This preprint presents a web app (essentially a web page-based program) with which two or more users (peers) can view and handle 3D molecular structures in a concurrent, interactive way through their web browsers. This means they can share orientation and zoom level, commands and other operations in almost real time over the Internet through standard web pages. This web app, open source and built with the open source components JSmol for molecular visualization and Peer.js for WebRTC connection, provides a practical tool for online collaboration and teaching at a distance. More broadly, it illustrates the strong integrability of technologies for client-side web programming, and paves the way for similar apps for concurrent work in other disciplines. Web app is available at: http://lucianoabriata.altervista.org/jsinscience/concurrent-jsmol/concurrent-jsmol-visualization.html ", "text": "bstract. preprint presents users view handle molecular structures concurrent interactive browsers. means share orientation zoom level commands operations almost real time internet standard pages. open source built open source components jsmol molecular visualization peer.js webrtc connection provides practical tool online collaboration teaching distance. broadly illustrates strong integrability technologies client-side programming paves similar apps concurrent work disciplines. available http//lucianoabriata.altervista.org/jsinscience/concurrent-jsmol/concurrent-jsmol-visualization.html figure scheme depicting allows user work molecular representation send states commands seamlessly users yielding smooth computationally inexpensive collaborative experience receiver user also effectively intervene. essentially provides direct browser-to-browser connectivity transmit jsmol states commands users. user rotates zooms structure his/her screen induces rotations zooms screens users subsecond latency. likewise user jsmol command oncurrent molecular structures internet essential efficient collaboration teaching distant locations like chemistry structural biology. possible achieve concurrent visualization screen-sharing programs; however number disadvantages. first large amounts video streamed internet potentially resulting slow experience and/or decreased graphics quality receiving peer. second confidential information could captured video streams internet. third probably important receiver control shortcomings alleviated prototypical introduced here uses simple methods existing commodity software provide unique experience concurrent interactive molecular visualization handling internet. provided based jsmol molecular visualization peer.js simplified socket-based connectivity libraries could used too. his/her visualization apply command users’ visualizations. since software system transfers small pieces text-like information states commands graphics experience fluid even average internet connections. also molecular files loaded user never sent internet protecting privacy. user must http//lucianoabriata.altervista.org/jsinscience/conc urrent-jsmol/concurrent-jsmol-visualization.html. user’s page loads gets assigned random peerjs least user must communicated users users receive master user connect him/her. users select whether jsmol commands master user apply visualizations whether apply rotations states visualizations commands master user. independently pair users additionally connect send receive states commands directly them. self-contained single html file. uses sockets plugin-less molecular viewer browsers html javascript code controls sends rotations commands applied peer peers whether rotations commands received another user applied. prototype show feasibility multiple modifications additions worth exploring. example could useful transmit commands typed jsmol applet also command applied directly jsmol interface console. also additional commands prebuilt buttons could implemented depending intended uses example shall promote development interfaces concurrent work disciplines. molecular sciences virtually discipline transmitting small pieces data transform views users’ devices help better communicate ideas concepts distance.", "year": "2017"}
