{"title": "PDB-NMA of a Protein Homodimer Reproduces Distinct Experimental Motility  Asymmetry", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We have extended our analytically derived PDB-NMA formulation, ATMAN [1], to include protein dimers using mixed internal and Cartesian coordinates. A test case on a 1.3\\AA\\ resolution model of a small homodimer, ActVA-ORF6, consisting of two 112-residue subunits identically folded in a compact 50\\AA\\ sphere, reproduces the distinct experimental Debye-Waller motility asymmetry for the two chains, demonstrating that structure sensitively selects vibrational signatures. The vibrational analysis of this PDB entry, together with biochemical and crystallographic data, demonstrates the cooperative nature of the dimeric interaction of the two subunits and suggests a mechanical model for subunit interconversion during the catalytic cycle.
