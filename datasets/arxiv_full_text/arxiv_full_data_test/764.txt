{"title": "Mean-field modeling of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system. II.  Dynamics of parkinsonian oscillations", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Neuronal correlates of Parkinson's disease (PD) include a slowing of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchrony at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of PD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect pathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical interactions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with a strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal ganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration correlates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments. Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with realistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient stimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity changes and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections in PD. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary for these results.
