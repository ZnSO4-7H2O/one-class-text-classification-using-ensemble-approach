{"title": "Interplay of activation kinetics and the derivative conductance  determines resonance properties of neurons", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In a neuron with hyperpolarization activated current ($I_h$), the correct input frequency leads to an enhancement of the output response. This behavior is known as resonance and is well described by the neuronal impedance. In a simple neuron model we derive equations for the neuron's resonance and we link its frequency and existence with the biophysical properties of $I_h$. For a small voltage change, the component of the ratio of current change to voltage change ($dI/dV$) due to the voltage-dependent conductance change ($dg/dV$) is known as derivative conductance ($G_h^{Der}$). We show that both $G_h^{Der}$ and the current activation kinetics (characterized by the activation time constant $\\tau_h$) are mainly responsible for controlling the frequency and existence of resonance. The increment of both factors ($G_h^{Der}$ and $\\tau_h$) greatly contributes to the appearance of resonance. We also demonstrate that resonance is voltage dependent due to the voltage dependence of $G_h^{Der}$. Our results have important implications and can be used to predict and explain resonance properties of neurons with the $I_h$ current.
