{"title": "On Kinetic Equations for Collisional Dynamics of Active Soft Condensed  Matter", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We consider a new approach to the description of the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations for observables of such systems. This representation of the kinetic evolution seems, in fact, the direct mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditional notion of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and it is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures.
