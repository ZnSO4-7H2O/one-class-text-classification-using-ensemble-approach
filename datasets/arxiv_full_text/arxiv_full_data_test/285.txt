{"title": "Object categorization in finer levels requires higher spatial  frequencies, and therefore takes longer", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The human visual system contains a hierarchical sequence of modules that take part in visual perception at different levels of abstraction, i.e., superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels. One important question is to identify the \"entry\" level at which the visual representation is commenced in the process of object recognition. For a long time, it was believed that the basic level had advantage over two others; a claim that has been challenged recently. Here we used a series of psychophysics experiments, based on a rapid presentation paradigm, as well as two computational models, with bandpass filtered images to study the processing order of the categorization levels. In these experiments, we investigated the type of visual information required for categorizing objects in each level by varying the spatial frequency bands of the input image. The results of our psychophysics experiments and computational models are consistent. They indicate that the different spatial frequency information had different effects on object categorization in each level. In the absence of high frequency information, subordinate and basic level categorization are performed inaccurately, while superordinate level is performed well. This means that, low frequency information is sufficient for superordinate level, but not for the basic and subordinate levels. These finer levels require high frequency information, which appears to take longer to be processed, leading to longer reaction times. Finally, to avoid the ceiling effect, we evaluated the robustness of the results by adding different amounts of noise to the input images and repeating the experiments. As expected, the categorization accuracy decreased and the reaction time increased significantly, but the trends were the same.This shows that our results are not due to a ceiling effect.

level basic level shorter subordinate level addition diﬀerences longer experiments. considering accuracies three main conclusions drawn. first using information humans could quickly accurately accomplish superordinate categorization. while much longer information despite reasonable accuracy. together suggests superordinate categorization mainly done using information. second although categorization basic subordinate levels using information completed faster accuracies low. therefore information sufﬁcient basic subordinate levels. intuitively superordinate level high inter-category dissimilarity therefore information suﬃcient performing task. subordinate tasks higher inter-category similarity higher frequency information required carries details object. third complete basic subordinate level categorization subjects needed information. however higher frequencies processed later lower ones. hence concluded superordinate level entry object categorization level then

human accuracy pattern mainly information content diﬀerent frequency bands. band overall shape object preserved details removed categorization superordinate level done high accuracy. coarse information useful categorization levels categories shape similarities. therefore visual system needs detailed information lies higher frequency bands. stated before lower spatial frequencies processed faster higher ones therefore computationally diﬃcult visual cortex superordinate categorization basic subordinate levels. huge variation among objects category. therefore lower frequencies maintain overall shape objects contain required information superordinate level categorization. however basic subordinate levels higher frequency bands informative. compared subordinate level basic

psychophysics experiments although relation global visual processing information debated coarse information obviously excluded hsf-ﬁltered images whereas details sharp edges textures absent lsfﬁltered images. results psychophysics experiments reveal using spatial frequencies humans could accurately perform superordinate level categorization. while basic subordinate levels higher frequency information required humans could reach high precisions using information. addition accuracy basic level greater subordinate level bands. together indicate basic level fully dependent bands. also band human accuracy categorization levels almost equal. suggests bands carry however results contrary ﬁndings collin mcmullen suggested highest accuracy information reached basic level superordinate subordinate levels rely higher frequencies. contradiction could employed speeded category veriﬁcation task included analysis beyond object detection. actually presented category name followed object image subjects report matched not. reading language cortical areas might activated visual process give advantage basic level superordinate level. therefore type experiment criticized involving semantic processing brain result compatible theory coarse-to-ﬁne temporal processing visual system lower frequencies processed earlier higher ones independently categorization level. addition subjects’ superordinate level shorter basic level. suggest superordinate level entry categorization level subordinate level latest one. however results contradicts ﬁndings earlier studies suggesting temporal advantage basic level categorization. particularly collin mcmullen suggested that whatever spatial frequency band basic level completed earlier superordinate subordinate levels. again could employed speeded category veriﬁcation paradigm long stimulus presentation time experiments. computational point view results could information content frequency band underlying neural processes involving object categorization level. used computational models categorization experiments humans did. models employ diﬀerent frequency ﬁltering mechanisms; uses gabor ﬁlters high spatial frequencies
