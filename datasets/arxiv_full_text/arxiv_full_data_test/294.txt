{"title": "Characterization of amylin-induced calcium dysregulation in rat  ventricular cardiomyocytes", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Hyperamylinemia, a condition characterized by above-normal blood levels of the pancreas-derived peptide amylin, accompanies obesity and precedes type II diabetes. Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas, brain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation. In the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form modestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the cell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a dose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+ conduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular Ca2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of amylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is sufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+ transients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these questions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling to reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and decreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function stemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this model, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was sufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that amplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of calmodulin. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced by deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in pre-diabetes.
