{"title": "Modeling Evolution of Crosstalk in Noisy Signal Transduction Networks", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Signal transduction networks can form highly interconnected systems within cells due to network crosstalk, the sharing of input signals between multiple downstream responses. To better understand the evolutionary design principles underlying such networks, we study the evolution of crosstalk and the emergence of specificity for two parallel signaling pathways that arise via gene duplication and are subsequently allowed to diverge. We focus on a sequence based evolutionary algorithm and evolve the network based on two physically motivated fitness functions related to information transmission. Surprisingly, we find that the two fitness functions lead to very different evolutionary outcomes, one with a high degree of crosstalk and the other without.
