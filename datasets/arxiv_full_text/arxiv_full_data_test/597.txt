{"title": "Large-deviation properties of the extended Moran model", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The distributions of the times to the first common ancestor t_mrca is numerically studied for an ecological population model, the extended Moran model. This model has a fixed population size N. The number of descendants is drawn from a beta distribution Beta(alpha, 2-alpha) for various choices of alpha. This includes also the classical Moran model (alpha->0) as well as the uniform distribution (alpha=1). Using a statistical mechanics-based large-deviation approach, the distributions can be studied over an extended range of the support, down to probabilities like 10^{-70}, which allowed us to study the change of the tails of the distribution when varying the value of alpha in [0,2]. We find exponential distributions p(t_mrca)~ delta^{t_mrca} in all cases, with systematically varying values for the base delta. Only for the cases alpha=0 and alpha=1, analytical results are known, i.e., delta=\\exp(-2/N^2) and delta=2/3, respectively. We recover these values, confirming the validity of our approach. Finally, we also study the correlations between t_mrca and the number of descendants.

sardine also virus population genetics case number offspring modeled distributions large variance often called skewed offspring distributions. thus parent might dominate next generation therefore address parent super parent. considering moran-like models often calls extended moran models. taking coalescence viewpoint corresponding models fraction ancestral lines merge called λ-coalescent denoting offspring distribution. imposed strong ﬂuctuations time scales much shorter case narrow offspring distributions i.e. sub-linear population size note also physics viewpoint surprising large ﬂuctuations lead effects. well known e.g. case phase transitions ﬂuctuations grow approaching phase-transition point. nevertheless contrast wright-fisher moran model models skewed offspring
