{"title": "Correlations of single-cell division times with and without periodic  forcing", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Periodic forcing of nonlinear oscillators leads to a large number of dynamic behaviors. The coupling of the cell-cycle to the circadian clock provides a biological realization of such forcing. Using high throughput single-cell microscopy, we have studied the correlations between cell cycle duration in discrete lineages of several different organisms including those with known coupling to a circadian clock and those without known coupling to a circadian clock. Correlations between cell cycles duration in discrete lineages observed in the organisms with a circadian clock cannot be explained by a simple statistical model but are consistent with predictions of a biologically plausible two dimensional nonlinear map. Surprisingly, the nonlinear map is equivalent to a classic nonlinear map called the fattened Arnold map. The model predicts that circadian coupling may increase cell to cell variability in a clonal population of cells. In agreement with this prediction, deletion of the circadian clock reduces variability. Our results show that simple correlations can identify systems under periodic forcing and that studies of nonlinear coupling of biological oscillators provide insight into basic cellular processes of growth.
