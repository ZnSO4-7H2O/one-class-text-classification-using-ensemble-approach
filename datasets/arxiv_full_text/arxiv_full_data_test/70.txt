{"title": "Certain amplified genomic-DNA fragments (AGFs) may be involved in cell  cycle progression and chloroquine is found to induce the production of  cell-cycle-associated AGFs (CAGFs) in Plasmodium falciparum", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " It is well known that cyclins are a family of proteins that control cell-cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinase. Based on our experimental results, we propose here a novel hypothesis that certain amplified genomic-DNA fragments (AGFs) may also be required for the cell cycle progression of eukaryotic cells and thus can be named as cell-cycle-associated AGFs (CAGFs). Like fluctuation in cyclin levels during cell cycle progression, these CAGFs are amplified and degraded at different points of the cell cycle. The functions of CAGFs are unknown, but we speculate that CAGFs might be involved in regulation of gene expression, genome protection, and formation of certain macromolecular complexes required for the dynamic genome architecture during cell cycle progression. Our experimental results also show that chloroquine induces the production of CAGFs in Plasmodium falciparum, suggesting that targeting cell cycle progression can be the primary mechanism of chloroquine's antimalarial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory actions.

introduction around years performed experiment plasmodium falciparum chloroquine -resistant isolate falciparum cq-sensitive isolate treated genomic isolated different intervals subjected using arbitrary primer. results experiment showed banding patterns displayed time dependent cell cycle dependent changes control cq-treated groups since could find reasonable explanation results also time research interests mainly focussed finding genetic differences cq-resistant cq-sensitive isolates eventually discovery novel falciparum resistance marker protein gene carry investigation reason banding patterns exhibited cell cycle dependent changes control cqtreated groups. recently read articles cyclins discovered important proteins controlling cell cycle progression activating cyclin-dependent kinase fluctuation cyclin levels cell cycle progression reminds rethinking cell cycle dependent changes banding patterns described above. possible certain genomic-dna fragments

evidence support hypothesis mainstay malaria chemotherapy many decades widely used treatment conditions including used adjunct anticancer therapy mechanism action remains unresolved. hypotheses mechanism cq’s action exert action either intercalating inducing apoptosis experimental methods genomic-dna isolation malaria parasites synchronised ring stage earliest stage intra-erythrocytic cycle malaria parasite exposed various concentrations. treated control parasites cultured laboratory routine conditions harvested treatment. harvested parasites incubated lysis buffer overnight. lysates

products separated agarose electrophoresis stained ethidium bromide visualised ultraviolet light. results discussion isolates treated respective concentrations. genomic isolated intervals treatment subject arbitrarily-primed using arbitrary primer named results showed distinct types banding patterns. bands remained unchanged throughout sampling interval referred stable bands. five stable bands

produced single primer annealed counter-directional sites genomic-dna fragment. sequence sites showed typical codon usage falciparum blast search amino acid databases revealed sequence shared similarity gene unknown function escherichia coli based full sequence fragment internal specific primers adjacent sites designed synthesized. expected band produced smaller band thus could named ub-related band. using h-isolated samples isolates rechecked pcr. results showed single ub-related band found samples bands cq-treated group much brighter bigger control group theory genomic control groups remain unchanged nature also quantity throughout sampling period isolates synthesis falciparum takes place intra-erythrocytic cycle started genomic remains unchanged banding patterns control groups remain cq-treated groups genomic malaria parasite could damaged treatment number bands smaller cq-treated groups control groups genomic-dna damage means quality quantity template affected. surprisingly results described totally different anticipated. since time could figure control cq-treated groups exhibited cell cycle dependent changes didn’t carry further investigation publish results although results highly reproducible. inspired cyclin’s discovery think results could reasonably explained hypothesis proposed above. order easily observe cell cycle dependent changes summarized appearance disappearance tables templates could considered represent different unknown-sized cagfs. arbitrarily-primed analysis h-isolated samples isolates neither band band found products control groups however specific primers used ub-related band found product control groups reason difference arbitrarily-primed analysis number templates h-isolated genomic control groups enough arbitrary primer mispaired annealing usually much less efficient specific primers analysis therefore produce visible band products genomic-dna templates required arbitrarily-primed compared using specific primers. word reason displayed cell cycle dependent changes control groups isolates number genomic-dna templates increased decreased different points cell cycle indicating related genomic-dna fragments i.e. cagfs amplified degraded different points cell cycle. since cagfs easily amplified degraded cell cycle progression certainly incorporated genome released genome nucleoplasm. mentioned above h-isolated genomic-dna samples rechecked using ub-related bands groups treated concentration found much brighter bigger control groups. reasonable explanation differences number genomic-dna templates increased cq-treated groups although time didn’t perform quantitative analysis. reason appeared products h-isolated cq-treated samples isolates could induce production ub-related cagfs malaria parasite. based results h-isolated samples lane figure lane best concentration inducing ub-related cagfs isolates. overall poorest concentration inducing ub-related cagfs isolates. conclusion drawn checking total number cq-treated groups induces production cagfs falciparum could greatly affect intraerythrocytic cycle progression malaria parasite， suggesting targeting cell cycle progression

experimental results cagfs synthesized amplified cell cycle progression synthesis phase falciparum indicates unknown synthesis mechanism might exist outside phase cell cycle. like inducible mrna transcripts cagfs genome-released drug-inducible easily degraded cell cycle progression enables speculate cagfs might single-stranded fragments synthesized process dna-to-dna transcription similar dna-to-rna transcription using polymerase instead polymerase. present don’t know many different cagfs involved cell cycle progression eukaryotic cells many different cagfs could induced treatment. primer used experiment detect ub-related cagfs detecting cq-induced cagfs different arbitrary primers designed tested. functions cagfs unknown speculate cagfs might involved regulation gene expression formation certain macromolecular complexes required dynamic genome architecture cell cycle progression furthermore since cagfs chromosomal well protected proteins amplified released nucleoplasm could easily exposed dna-damaging agents enter nucleus absorbing attack effects thus might function bodyguards protect genome damage. induces production cagfs malaria parasite could also interpreted genome defence response dna-damaging agents. time cagfs produced nucleus might cause chaos regulation cell cycle progression contribute understanding mechanism many studies shown cause cell cycle arrest various cancer cells cell cycle arrest mediated cq-induced cagfs might intervene gene expression regulation cell cycle progression cagfs could deemed brake pads slow stop cell cycle progression. possibly cancers might arise cells brake failure occurred. conclusion hypothesis proposed paper based preliminary experimental results obtained falciparum. whether stand testing eukaryotic cells investigations needed. order provide convenience want repeat experiment presented sequences specific primers paper. hopefully studies using wide range methods hypothesis eventually incorporated
