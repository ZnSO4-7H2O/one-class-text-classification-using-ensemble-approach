{"title": "Robots as Powerful Allies for the Study of Embodied Cognition from the  Bottom Up", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials, sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach, focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes, (b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition. We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust, resilient, and safe.

arms attached hips ability walk exclusively downward slope incline walks mechanical parameters walker walking movement entirely result finely tuned mechanics right kind surface. motivation research also show human walking possible minimal energy limited central control. however problems animals robots faced real world cannot solved solely passive interaction physical body environment. typically active involvement means muscles/motors required. furthermore actuation pattern needs specified agent hence controller sort required. nevertheless turns physical interaction body environment exploited

unprecedented mobility mechanical feedback loops constitute basic illustration contribution embodiment embeddedness behavior. immediate next level probably attributed direct reflex-like sensorimotor

braitenberg designed whole series two-wheeled vehicles increasing complexity. already primitive ones sensors directly connected motors display sophisticated behaviors. although driving mechanisms simple entirely deterministic interaction real world brings noise gives rise complex behavioral patterns hard predict. line picked rodney brooks added explicit anti-representationalist perspective response meantime firmly established cognitivistic paradigm ``good old-fashioned artificial intelligence'' brooks openly attacked gofai position seminal articles ``intelligence without
