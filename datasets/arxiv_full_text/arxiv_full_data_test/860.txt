{"title": "Thermodynamic Mechanism of Life and Aging", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Life is a complex biological phenomenon represented by numerous chemical, physical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic system/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject to aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in biological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern processes in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to change of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state of an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological, biological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the moment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization represents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new thermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing thermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as aging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter that is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the beginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter (growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a consequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition, fragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).

chemical reactions what life? question first raised schrodinger wanted show necessity life processes obey laws physics chemistry. however general agreement scientific community answer even today. even controversial question what aging except general agreement aging irreversible process closely related life time flow. many hypotheses cause aging. literature describes seven characteristics common living organisms. living organisms built structures called cells grow change complex chemistry maintain homeostasis respond environment reproduce offspring pass traits onto offspring. according first characteristic living organisms cellular structure. cell corresponds description thermodynamic system certain amount matter clearly separated boundaries surrounding exchanges matter energy. thus cell considered open thermodynamic system shown bertalanffy thermodynamic system cell characterized state parameters change state parameters represents process. obvious life aging processes lead change

characterized mass volume internal energy enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy amount information aging process changes state parameters. life occurs approximately constant temperature constant pressure. thus aging process isobaric isothermal. variable parameters volume increase volume caused accumulation mass. change mass change enthalpy internal energy entropy gibbs free energy information… therefore state characterized properties state living organism changes aging. aging complex phenomenon includes physiological changes cytological changes histological changes almost existing theories aging based certain observations regard morphological biochemical changes occur aging. however none explains physical reason causes aging process. single theory generally accepted popular free radical theory aging based chemical nature ubiquitous presence free radicals suggests aging changes caused free radical reactions oxidative damage theory aging seemed almost proved. recently criticized. attempt made modify according proposed neo-oxidative damage theory oxidative damage major contributor aging evolutionary theory aging currently popular aging theory. kirkwood reports specific genes selected promote aging unlikely exist. according aging programmed results largely accumulation somatic damage owing limited investments maintenance repair. however genetic

change state parameters. difference aging living non-living systems living systems positive change parameters however non-living systems change volume mass amount matter internal energy entropy less than equal greater zero. seems obvious life begins process fertilization. fertilization process represents moment formation thermodynamic system components. seems obvious that fertilization cell division growth aging occur. question appears growth aging distinct parallel processes growth integral part aging process? process increase mass volume amount matter system. mass accumulation accumulation entropy enthalpy internal energy. entropy increase gibbs free energy negative. thus growth spontaneous process caused accumulation matter. immediately formation zygote changes parameters lead change state. change state system defined aging aging process begins moment organism formed. indeed aging embryos monitored chronologically days months also thermodynamically irreversible consecutive continuous changes state. aging organism begins formation ends death. death aging continues aging non-living systems objects. figure continuous change biological thermodynamic state organism situated closed system trough accumulation matter increases mass. increasing mass increases entropy enthalpy internal energy. organism situated open system also exponentially increases mass entropy. concluded life process aging organism changes thermodynamic parameter. thus aging represents complex thermodynamic process. process state organism changes irreversibly consecutively continuously state another. state characterized state parameters. hard limit analysis aging change parameter shown organism changes parameters state transitions changes state parameters must considered analyzing aging process. reason change parameters leads changes others. seems driving force life also reason aging process. therefore aging begins fertilization ceases death. therefore concluded life aging sides coin. people intuitively understand aging process chronologically. many consider time flow cause aging. however different organisms different rates. even though correlation time aging obviously exists different organisms change states time. macroscopically means people different rates. intensity changes characterize aging different people chronological age. next obvious example fact aging begin lipofuscin accumulation oxidative damage telomere shortening first cell division continues entire lifespan. therefore changes state organism appear since beginning fertilization zygote formation. indeed immediately fertilization cell begins grow divide. leads change parameters states states system characteristic aging. leads conclusion that even though changes structure function characterize aging significantly contribute change state driving force aging process. even though structural changes molecules significantly contribute aging process also appear later life cannot responsible change state organism embryonic development aging represents change state cell represents thermodynamic system fundamental driving force change state accumulation matter accumulation errors. accumulation matter occurs parallel time flow cell growth either volume division. cases increase mass volume organism leads state transition. mass accumulation except volume increase leads increase enthalpy entropy. aging spontaneous irreversible process. concluded free energy change negative obvious that according gibbs equation entropy contribution aging greater enthalpy contribution. change mass positive consequence growth specific entropy substances greater equal zero third thermodynamics. therefore change entropy organism must positive. change entropy related changes parameters related aging. entropy change related mass change equation internal energy change also related entropy change. internal energy change related change entropy combining equation specific internal energy energy unit mass. molecular changes characteristic aging also related entropy change according hayflick entropy related number microstates available system boltzmann equation boltzmann constant entropy change thus seems obvious entropy change describes changes state characteristic aging best way. entropy change early phases consequence change parameters caused matter accumulation. later life growth matter accumulation cease. entropy change adult senescent phase caused mostly changes structure live matter decomposition processes however accumulation cease completely since erroneous molecules continues accumulate. another advantage using entropy quantify aging subject second thermodynamics. gives additional constraints analysis automatically removes models physical meaningful. furthermore thermodynamic systems behave according laws thermodynamics well established experimentally validated making analysis reliable. living nonliving matter.
