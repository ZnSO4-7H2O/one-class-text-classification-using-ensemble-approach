{"title": "Moral attitudes and willingness to induce cognitive enhancement and  repair with brain stimulation", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The availability of technological means to enhance and repair human cognitive function raises questions about the perceived morality of their use. In this study, we administered a survey to the public in which subjects were asked to report how willing they would be to enhance and/or repair specific cognitive abilities. Among 894 responders, we found that subjects were more willing to use technologies to repair other people than themselves, and especially to enhance or repair functions more \"core\" to authentic identity in others. Subjects' ratings of the moral acceptability of specific uses was related to their reported willingness to use brain stimulation. These findings suggest that the public endorses an altruistic approach to applying brain stimulation for cognitive gains. Further, this study establishes a basis to guide moral psychological studies of cognitive modification and social processes that guide attitudes toward and uses of brain stimulation.

contributes willingness brain stimulation zero-sum scenarios. given vignettes indicating hypothetical brain stimulation technology comes limited supply subjects prioritized repair enhancement alignment moral judgments. however overall willingness brain stimulation core peripheral functions rather others opposite direction ratings moral acceptability. suggests moral evaluation contribute judgments repair enhancing functions override moral dispositions case self versus brain stimulation uses signiﬁcant main effects conditions. observed opposite directions subjects believe somewhat appropriate modify themselves report willingness apply brain stimulation others. subject’s high willingness repair core functions others suggest additional social dispositions override certain moral intuitions. research shows moral commitments dissociate moral judgments current study suggests important clarifying links core moral commitments discrete moral judgments hypothetical willingness real-world behavior brain stimulation uses. similar dissociations personlevel policy level observed attitudes toward pharmaceuticals enhancement clear systematic research continue assess speciﬁc moral attitudes relationships hypothetical willingness actual behavior. surprising ﬁnding individuals willing inﬂuence others speciﬁcally core functions bears special consideration. general know little public views potential resource distribution cognitive enhancement. possible individuals current study altruistically inclined repair others’ true selves self lost brain injury. curiously individuals less inclined endorse repair core functions themselves. speculatively could difﬁculty imagining like lose one’s authentic holistic sense self relatively easier task able observe others change injuries public imagination experiences friends family. potential link imaginability willingness could explicitly tested future studies. additional nuance worth noting partial support prediction individuals would favor self-enhancement performance gains others. speciﬁcally individuals likely enhance repair peripheral features relative others. since peripheral features include valuable performance-based economy possible individuals prioritize uses personal gains others. examining individuals’ beliefs links speciﬁc functions real-world outcomes could clarify ﬁnding. further examining relationships moral commitments moral judgment could help explain individuals favor speciﬁc uses others. interestingly contrary prior work pharmaceuticals individuals less willing inﬂuence traits core authentic identity hypothetical brain stimulation. indicates consumer intuitions differ hypothetical mechanism delivery. brain stimulation pharmaceuticals neuromodulatory inﬂuence cognition. however brain stimulation generally administered exogenously using electromagnetism whereas pharmaceuticals administered intra-orally chemically modulate metabolic neural cerebrovascular effects. moreover brain stimulation predominantly emerged whereas pharmaceutical manufacturing began late means public awareness acceptance reasoning pharmaceuticals developed many decades longer brain stimulation concerning exception sociocultural processes shape evaluation speciﬁc mechanisms interventions public professional acceptance could inform important area study research pertinent reasoning public policy. vein research contributes important empirical basis research informing public education outreach policy could develop. several groups opined growing trends toward brain stimulation could lead issues ethical equitable distribution clinical enhancing neuroaesthetic uses brain stimulation moreover public worried enthusiastic enhancement using invasive forms brain stimulation enhance also efforts educate caution home brain stimulation users unknown harmful effects thus several stakes amenable empirical inquiry. ﬁrst concerns effects speciﬁc uses brain stimulation investigators must determine functions affected degree circumstances second depending ﬁrst concerns whether ethical equitable distribution feasible third motivated current work concerns objective facts brain stimulation ethical equitable distribution brain stimulation viewed public professional brain stimulation practitioners. latter issue heretofore largely subject intensive conceptual discussions opinions despite fact public demonstrably sensitive many debates stakes. pressingly objective study public professional attitudes behaviors toward brain stimulation required make informed decisions phenomena effect actual practices brain stimulation might seek inﬂuence processes stimulation ﬁndings suggest least directions worth immediate inquiry. first described above studying judgments inﬂuences intervention’s mechanism action individuals’ understanding objective effects important. second seek connect judgments interventions brain stimulation broader research human decision making neuroeconomics moral

test moral acceptability inﬂuenced change judgments brain stimulation whether cognitive-emotional processes contribute modiﬁed. indeed found individuals viewed affecting brain stimulation morally acceptable overall willing brain stimulation others repair core functions essential empathic altruistic functioning. limitations several limitations current study addressed future research. current study subject limitations inherent self-report survey research. cannot identify causal inﬂuences current study. addition structure survey allow test possible order dependencies reports willingness

variables examined. interesting future direction would examine item-level effects terms accurately assessing attitudes identifying targets inﬂuencing judgments. addition included speciﬁc mechanism

individuals reluctant atheists agnostics willing receive enhancements religious afﬁliation interact variables explored here including underlying moral evaluations. finally prior research suggests survey data collected mechanical turk representative data acquired person unknown whether generalizes current context. uses brain stimulation increasingly available empirical studies regarding public

morally acceptable degree acceptability informs repair functions core identity others odds willingness endorse speciﬁc uses. future efforts begin apply ﬁndings contexts beyond brain stimulation inform
