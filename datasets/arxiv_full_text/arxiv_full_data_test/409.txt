{"title": "Collective excitability in a mesoscopic neuronal model of epileptic  activity", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The brain can be understood as a collection of interacting neuronal oscillators, but the extent to which its sustained activity is due to coupling among brain areas is still unclear. Here we study the joint dynamics of two cortical columns described by Jansen-Rit neural mass models, and show that coupling between the columns gives rise to stochastic initiations of sustained collective activity, which can be interpreted as epileptic events. For large enough coupling strengths, termination of these events results mainly from the emergence of synchronization between the columns, and thus is controlled by coupling instead of noise. Stochastic triggering and noise-independent durations are characteristic of excitable dynamics, and thus we interpret our results in terms of collective excitability.
