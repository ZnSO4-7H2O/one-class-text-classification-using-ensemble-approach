{"title": "Mechanics of epithelial tissue formation", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A key process in the life of any multicellular organism is its development from a single egg into a full grown adult. The first step in this process often consists of forming a tissue layer out of randomly placed cells on the surface of the egg. We present a model for generating such a tissue, and find that the resulting cellular pattern corresponds to the Voronoi tessellation of the nuclei of the cells. Experimentally, we obtain the same result in both fruit flies and flour beetles, with a distribution of cell shapes that matches that of the model, without any adjustable parameters. Finally, we show that this pattern is broken when the cells do not all grow at the same rate.

understand formation pattern mechanical interactions cells. growing cells eventually come contact neighbors resulting mechanical feedback causes stop growing towards neighbor. contacts moreover translate back mechanical force nuclei cells causes re-position eventually form observed voronoi tessellation. thus mechanical interactions largely determine cell arrangement shape epithelial tissues.
