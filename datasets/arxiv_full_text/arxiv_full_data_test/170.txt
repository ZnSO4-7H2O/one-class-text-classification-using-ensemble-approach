{"title": "Toward a Designable Extracellular Matrix: Molecular Dynamics Simulations  of an Engineered Laminin-mimetic, Elastin-like Fusion Protein", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Native extracellular matrices (ECMs), such as those of the human brain and other neural tissues, exhibit networks of molecular interactions between specific matrix proteins and other tissue components. Guided by these naturally self-assembling supramolecular systems, we have designed a matrix-derived protein chimera that contains a laminin globular-like (LG) domain fused to an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). All-atom, classical molecular dynamics simulations of our designed laminin-elastin fusion protein reveal temperature-dependent conformational changes, in terms of secondary structure composition, solvent accessible surface area, hydrogen bonding, and surface hydration. These properties illuminate the phase behavior of this fusion protein, via the emergence of $\\beta$-sheet character in physiologically-relevant temperature ranges.
