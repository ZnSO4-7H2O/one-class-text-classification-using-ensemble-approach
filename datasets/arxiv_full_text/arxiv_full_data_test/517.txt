{"title": "The rules of long DNA-sequences and tetra-groups of oligonucleotides", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The article represents a new class of hidden symmetries in long sequences of oligonucleotides of single stranded DNA from their representative set. These symmetries are an addition to symmetries described by the second parity rule of Chargaff. These new symmetries and their rules concern collective probabilities of oligonucleotides from special tetra-groups and their subgroups in long DNA-texts including complete sets of chromosomes of human and some model organisms. These rules of tetra-group probabilities are considered as possible candidacies for the role of universal rules of long DNA-sequences. A quantum-informational model of genetic symmetries of these collective probabilities is proposed on the basis of the known quantum-mechanic statement that quantum state of a multicomponent system is defined by the tensor product of quantum states of its subsystems. In this model, nitrogenous bases C, T, G, A of DNA are represented as computational basis states of 2-qubit quantum CTGA-systems. The biological meaning of these new quantum-information symmetries of long DNA texts is associated with the common ability of all living organisms to grow and develop on the basis of incorporation into their body of new and new molecules of nutrients becoming new quantum-mechanic subsystems of the united quantum-mechanic organism. An important role of resonances, photons and photonic crystals in quantum information genetics is noted.
