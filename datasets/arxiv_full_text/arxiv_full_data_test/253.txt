{"title": "Proton tunneling in hydrogen bonds and its implications in an  induced-fit model of enzyme catalysis", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The role of proton tunneling in biological catalysis is investigated here within the frameworks of quantum information theory and thermodynamics. We consider the quantum correlations generated through two hydrogen bonds between a substrate and a prototypical enzyme that first catalyzes the tautomerization of the substrate to move on to a subsequent catalysis, and discuss how the enzyme can derive its catalytic potency from these correlations. In particular, we show that classical changes induced in the binding site of the enzyme spreads the quantum correlations among all of the four hydrogen-bonded atoms thanks to the directionality of hydrogen bonds. If the enzyme rapidly returns to its initial state after the binding stage, the substrate ends in a new transition state corresponding to a quantum superposition. Open quantum system dynamics can then naturally drive the reaction in the forward direction from the major tautomeric form to the minor tautomeric form without needing any additional catalytic activity. We find that in this scenario the enzyme lowers the activation energy so much that there is no energy barrier left in the tautomerization, even if the quantum correlations quickly decay.

scenario enzyme lowers activation energy much energy barrier left tautomerization even quantum correlations quickly decay. enzyme macromolecule catalyzes speciﬁc biological reactions without consumed. reactant molecule enzyme acts upon known substrate enzyme. conversion substrate products involves formation unstable intermediate structures called transition states uncatalysed reactions occur fast-enough rates high energies molecules. enzymes accelerate slow-rate reactions lowering energy required form transition state several ways e.g. destabilizing substrate stabilizing transition state

states enzyme exists equilibrium active inactive conformations incoming substrate binding. then intermolecular interaction stabilizes active conformation enzyme. unlike induced-ﬁt model conformational

oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases ligases. role proton tunneling enzyme catalysis investigated particularly focusing class oxidoreductases oxidize substrate transferring hydrogen acceptor molecule intermolecular h-bonds. according kinetic isotope eﬀects studies observed rates several enzyme-catalyzed oxidoreduction reactions cannot explained solely terms semi-classical transition-state theory without quantum-mechanical correction tunneling species moreover number diﬀerent studies including kinetic isotope experiments molecular dynamic simulations quantum mechanical molecular mechanics calculations qualitative quantum rate models give prominence role conformational change promoting tunneling. conversely experimental tests using artiﬁcial catalysts realistic simulations based path integral formulation suggest quantum tunneling oxidoreductase enzymes enhance reaction rates suﬃciently enough regarded catalytic. hence role tunneling species catalytic reactions still open debate debate summarized generally focuses enzymatic reactions involve proton transport carbon atoms rather nitrogen oxygen atoms expected form h-bonds strong enough show quantum character. also conformational changes enzymes usually considered context conformational selection model rather induced-ﬁt model requires signiﬁcant change conformation. extend present debate include strong h-bonds large conformational changes taking account tautomerization reactions protons relocated inside substrate molecules. special subclass structural isomerases known tautomerase superfamily normally responsible tautomerization reactions. reactions catalyzed known members superfamily usually involve proton transport and/or carbon atom too. however neither nature tautomerization role biocatalysis limited tautomerase activity. particular tautomerization nucleotides occurs generally proton transfer nitrogen oxygen atoms also charge initial stages various bio-catalyzed reactions. exchange protons likely carbonyl and/or amino groups nucleotides solvent molecules. thus single nucleotide exist many tautomeric forms solvent-mediated tautomerization. forms predominates physiological conditions called major tautomer. however tautomeric preferences diﬀerent enzymes also diﬀerent i.e. whereas major tautomeric form nucleotide substrate enzyme another enzyme
