{"title": "Quantum Information Biology: from information interpretation of quantum  mechanics to applications in molecular biology and cognitive psychology", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We discuss foundational issues of quantum information biology (QIB) -- one of the most successful applications of the quantum formalism outside of physics. QIB provides a multi-scale model of information processing in bio-systems: from proteins and cells to cognitive and social systems. This theory has to be sharply distinguished from \"traditional quantum biophysics\". The latter is about quantum bio-physical processes, e.g., in cells or brains. QIB models the dynamics of information states of bio-systems. It is based on the quantum-like paradigm: complex bio-systems process information in accordance with the laws of quantum information and probability. This paradigm is supported by plenty of statistical bio-data collected at all scales, from molecular biology and genetics/epigenetics to cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. We argue that the information interpretation of quantum mechanics (its various forms were elaborated by Zeilinger and Brukner, Fuchs and Mermin, and D' Ariano) is the most natural interpretation of QIB. We also point out that QBIsm (Quantum Bayesianism) can serve to find a proper interpretation of bio-quantum probabilities. Biologically QIB is based on two principles: a) adaptivity; b) openness (bio-systems are fundamentally open). These principles are mathematically represented in the framework of a novel formalism -- quantum adaptive dynamics which, in particular, contains the standard theory of open quantum systems as a special case of adaptivity (to environment).

strongly rejects unconscious-ensemble viewpoint quantum probabilities otherwise interprets subjective. reader diﬃcult probability interpretation problem even keeping rigidly subjective interpretation cannot interpretation problem solved completely. although aforementioned lecture zeilinger views zeilinger-brukner fuchs-mermin suﬃciently close important point fundamental diﬀerence approaches. interpretation zeilinger-brukner heavily based assumption quantum randomness irreducible. idea quantum randomness crucially differs classical present already neumann’s book pointed quantum randomness individual e.g. even individual electron intrinsically random classical randomness ensemble nature. series papers ideology developed quantum information framework serves base zeilinger-brukner
