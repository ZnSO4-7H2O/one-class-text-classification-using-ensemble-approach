{"title": "Eye-Movement behavior identification for AD diagnosis", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In the present work, we develop a deep-learning approach for differentiating the eye-movement behavior of people with neurodegenerative diseases over healthy control subjects during reading well-defined sentences. We define an information compaction of the eye-tracking data of subjects without and with probable Alzheimer's disease when reading a set of well-defined, previously validated, sentences including high-, low-predictable sentences, and proverbs. Using this information we train a set of denoising sparse-autoencoders and build a deep neural network with these and a softmax classifier. Our results are very promising and show that these models may help to understand the dynamics of eye movement behavior and its relationship with underlying neuropsychological correlates.
