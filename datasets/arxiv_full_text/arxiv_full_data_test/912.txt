{"title": "A novel methodology on distributed representations of proteins using  their interacting ligands", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " The effective representation of proteins is a crucial task that directly affects the performance of many bioinformatics problems. Related proteins usually bind to similar ligands. Chemical characteristics of ligands are known to capture the functional and mechanistic properties of proteins suggesting that a ligand based approach can be utilized in protein representation. In this study, we propose SMILESVec, a SMILES-based method to represent ligands and a novel method to compute similarity of proteins by describing them based on their ligands. The proteins are defined utilizing the word-embeddings of the SMILES strings of their ligands. The performance of the proposed protein description method is evaluated in protein clustering task using TransClust and MCL algorithms. Two other protein representation methods that utilize protein sequence, BLAST and ProtVec, and two compound fingerprint based protein representation methods are compared. We showed that ligand-based protein representation, which uses only SMILES strings of the ligands that proteins bind to, performs as well as protein-sequence based representation methods in protein clustering. The results suggest that ligand-based protein description can be an alternative to the traditional sequence or structure based representation of proteins and this novel approach can be applied to different bioinformatics problems such as prediction of new protein-ligand interactions and protein function annotation.

task. clustering algorithms relied similarity scores order group proteins. among protein sequence-based similarity methods poorest clustering performance super-family/family belonged blast e-value baseline. protein word frequency obtained best performance dataset super-family family clustering respectively. performances protvec ligand-based protein representation methods followed best result closely. though bringing semantic aspect learning wordvec model protvec-based similarity outperformed straightforward wordfrequency based approach. results also showed average-based combination method better min/max-based combination method build single protein vector subsequence vectors protein clustering task. since min/max-based combination method perform well sequence-based protein similarity test technique smilesbased protein similarity approaches. among ligand based representation methods examined performance word-based embeddings character-based embeddings well effect source training data embeddings. collected canonical smiles chembl pubchem databases. smiles strings interacting ligands collected chembl explained section main difference databases chembl allows isometric information molecule encoded within smiles. results clearly indicated choice training embedding learning important smiles concerned. case since smiles interacting ligands data collected chembl database performance smilesvec embeddings learned training chembl smiles rather pubchem smiles notably better. also investigated whether using combination smiles corpus chembl pubchem improve performance smilesvec embeddings. indeed reported improvement character-based embedding family clustering whereas word-based embedding produced f-measure values higher pubchem-based learning lower chemblbased learning. suggest increase performance character-based learning combination different smiles corpora might positively correlated increase smiles samples number unique letters appear smiles significantly change databases however word-based learning observed significant increase variety chemical words thus combined smiles corpus model work well character-based learning. result suggests size learning corpus affect representation embeddings thus might suggest larger smiles corpus could lead better character-based embeddings smilesvec. considering chembl trained smilesvec observe even though producing comparable scores word-based approach better characterbased smilesvec terms f-measure family clustering. super-family clustering however character-based approach performs well word-based smilesvec. similarly protvec also better represented word-level rather character-level. ligand-based protein representation methods smilesvec maccsbased approach performed almost well protvec family super-family clustering transclust algorithm even though protein sequence information used. lower clustering performance obtained compared transclust smilesvec maccs-based method produced slightly better f-measure protvec super-family family clustering. suggest that since ligand-based protein representation methods capture indirect function information ligand binding recognizably better detecting super-families families compared sequence-based protvec relatively distant data set. furthermore smilesvec text-based unsupervised learning model produced comparable fmeasure scores maccs extended fingerprints binary vectors based human-engineered feature descriptions. table reports pearson correlations among protein similarity computation methods. comparison blast e-value resulted negative correlation expected since e-values closer zero indicate high match ligand based protein representation methods higher correlation values blast e-value protein-sequence

smilesvec-based protein similarity protvec protein similarity using transclust algorithm. observed fibronectin type proteins clustered together smilesvec used whereas using protvec placed four different clusters; cluster contained four proteins another cluster contained single protein proteins part clusters. protein clustered interacting ligands also shared protein clustered separately protvec. thus suggest using information common interacting ligands smilesvec achieved combine seven proteins single cluster protvec failed sequence-based approach. study first propose ligand-representation method smilesvec uses word embeddings model. then represent proteins using interacting ligands. approach interacting ligands protein data collected. then smiles string ligand divided fixed-length overlapping substrings. created substrings used build real-valued vectors wordvec model vectors combined single vector represent whole smiles string. finally protein vectors

sequence-based models family/super-family clustering surprise. however ligand-based protein representation methods either learning smiles represented binary compound features performing well protein sequence-based models quite intriguing promising. smilesvec maccs representation performed similarly task protein clustering better extended fingerprint representation suggesting word-embeddings approach learns representations large smiles corpus unsupervised manner accurate knowledgebased fingerprint model. propose ligand-based representation proteins might reveal important clues especially protein-ligand interaction related tasks like drug specificity identification proteins drug targeting. similarity candidate ligand smilesvec protein used indicator possible interaction. would like mention astral data sets contain domains rather full length proteins chembl collects protein ligand interaction information based whole protein sequence uniprot. multidomain protein multiple diverse chemotypes ligands binding domain retrieving ligand information based full length protein lump disparate information together leading loss information domain specific ligand interactions. performance domain sequence based methods therefore advantage family/superfamily assignment scope also based domain sequence ligand based approach smilesvec uses noisy data. despite disadvantage ligand based approach performs well sequence based approaches. hypothesize domain ligand interactions taken account ligand based approaches would higher performance. study conducted also showed smiles description
