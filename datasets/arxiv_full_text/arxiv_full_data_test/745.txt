{"title": "A Three-Dimensional Mathematical Model of Collagen Contraction", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In this paper, we introduce a three-dimensional mathematical model of collagen contraction with microbuckling based on the two-dimensional model previously developed by the authors. The model both qualitatively and quantitatively replicates experimental data including lattice contraction over a time course of 40 hours for lattices with various cell densities, cell density profiles within contracted lattices, radial cut angles in lattices, and cell force propagation within a lattice. The importance of the model lattice formation and the crucial nature of its connectivity are discussed including differences with models which do not include microbuckling. The model suggests that most cells within contracting lattices are engaged in directed motion.
