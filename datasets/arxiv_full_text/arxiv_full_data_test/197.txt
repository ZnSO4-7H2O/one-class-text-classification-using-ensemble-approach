{"title": "Positive Feedback and Synchronized Bursts in Neuronal Cultures", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Synchronized bursts (SBs) with complex structures are common in neuronal cultures. Although the origin of SBs is still unclear, they have been studied for their information processing capabilities. Here, we investigate the properties of these SBs in a culture on multi-electrode array system. We find that structures of these SBs are related to the different developmental stages of the cultures. A model based on short term synaptic plasticity, recurrent connections and astrocytic recycling of neurotransmitters has been developed successfully to understand these structures. A phase diagram obtained from this model shows that networks exhibiting SBs are in an oscillatory state due to large enough positive feedback provided by synaptic facilitation and recurrent connections. In this model, the structures of the SBs are the results of intrinsic synaptic interactions; not information stored in the network.
