{"title": "9.5 Hypotheses on the Informational Structure of Life which are  Multi-scale, Human-readable, Provocative, Coherent, Plausible, Falsifiable,  and Actionable", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " This document has an unorthodox structure to accomplish an unorthodox goal: presenting the scaffolding for a zero-parameter Unified Theory of Life inside several dozen pages. Ideally, that length is short enough to be understood in a few hours, yet complete and principled enough to unfold into solutions to civilization's most urgent problem: the accelerating de-calibration of fluid human brains by compelling digitized signals. The stakes of understanding humans as informational beings are huge. Without drastic changes, crucial human functionality will vanish in a generation. Fortunately, the cures are cheap and easy if promoted properly. These ten hypotheses re-present in more abstract, encapsulated form a Framework published a few months ago in a reputable peer-reviewed journal, which concluded that human sensory systems must be accorded data of the same quality as the data which already trains algorithmic intelligences. While the lack of experiment-grade detail might make these hypotheses seem \"unscientific,\" in compensation the breadth of this Framework ought to provide the virtues of theory: clarity, simplicity, coherence, and self-evidence. Five of the hypotheses span humanity's current problem-space, and five a possible solution space. They are: H1.0 Stably evolving distributions must balance themselves between narrowing and broadening H2.0 Stabilization and homeostasis are fragile in multiple ways H3.0 Representing spacetime requires micro-timing and mega-assumptions H4.0 When in doubt, ping! H5.0 Mediated communication becomes infected with pinging H6.0 If scaling and incentives are the problems, then entropy and affection are the solutions H7.0 \"Paleo everything but violence\" provides
