{"title": "Stochastic kinetics of the circular gene hypothesis: feedback effects  and protein fluctuations", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Stochastic kinetic models of genetic expression are able to describe protein fluctuations. A comparative study of the canonical and a feedback model is given here by using stochastic simulation methods. The feedback model is skeleton model implementation of the circular gene hypothesis, which suggests the interaction between the synthesis and degradation of mRNA. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the shape and in the numerical characteristics of the stationary distributions suggest that more combined experimental and theoretical studies should be done to uncover the details of the kinetic mechanism of gene expression.
