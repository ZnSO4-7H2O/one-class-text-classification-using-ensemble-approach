{"title": "Adipochondrocytes in rabbit auricular cartilage", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Chondrocytes are described as one cell population in different cartilage types. The auricular cartilage in mouse and rat contains unique chondrocytes similar in morphology to white adipocytes and known as lipochondrocytes. Lipochondrocytes were not mentioned in other species. The current study aimed to explore the existence of this cell type in rabbits. The auricles of adult male white rabbits were harvested and processed for histological examination with light and electron microscopy. With the light microscopy, the auricular cartilage of adult rabbits contained central large rounded adipocyte-like chondrocytes, termed in the current study adipochondrocytes The adipochondrocytes were embedded in relatively wide lacunae and had large lipid droplets with a rim of cytoplasm. The scanning electron microscopy confirmed this result. With the transmission electron microscopy, the adipochondrocytes showed dark nucleus and electron-dense cytoplasm with few organelles and cytoplasmic processes. The adipochondrocytes of the auricular cartilage in adult rabbits were unique cell type and different from chondrocytes in other cartilage subtypes. This result should be considered during cartilage transplant. Further studies are suggested to investigate the development and physiological roles of adipochondrocytes in the auricular cartilage in rabbits.
