{"title": "Ubiquity of collective irregular dynamics in balanced networks of  spiking neurons", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We revisit the dynamics of a prototypical model of balanced activity in networks of spiking neutrons. A detailed investigation of the thermodynamic limit for fixed density of connections (massive coupling) shows that, when inhibition prevails, the asymptotic regime is not asynchronous but rather characterized by a self-sustained irregular, macroscopic (collective) dynamics. So long as the connectivity is massive, this regime is found in many different setups: leaky as well as quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons; large and small coupling strength; weak and strong external currents.
