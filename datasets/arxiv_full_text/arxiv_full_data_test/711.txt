{"title": "Modeling-based determination of physiological parameters of systemic  VOCs by breath gas analysis, part 2", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In a recent paper we presented a simple two compartment model which describes the influence of inhaled concentrations on exhaled breath concentrations for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with small Henry constants. In this paper we extend this investigation concerning the influence of inhaled concentrations on exhaled breath concentrations for VOCs with higher Henry constants.  To this end we extend our model with an additional compartment which takes into account the influence of the upper airways on exhaled breath VOC concentrations.
