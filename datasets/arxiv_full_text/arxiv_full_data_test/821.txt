{"title": "On the dynamics of a cancer tumor growth model with multiphase structure", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " In this paper, we study a phase-space analysis of a mathematical model of tumor growth with an immune response. Mathematical analysis of the model equations with multipoint initial condition, regarding to dissipativity, boundedness of solutions, invariance of non-negativity, nature of equilibria, local and global stability will be investigated. We study some features of behavior of one three-dimensional tumor growth model with dynamics described in terms of densities of three cells populations: tumor cells, healthy host cells and effector immune cells. We find the upper and lower bounds for the effector immune cells population. Further, we derive sufficient conditions under which trajectories from the positive domain of feasible multipoint initial conditions tend to one of equilibrium points. Here cases of the small tumor mass equilibrium point; the healthy equilibrium point; the \"death\" equilibrium point are examined. Biological implications of our results are considered ", "text": "paper study phase-space analysis mathematical model tumor growth immune response. mathematical analysis model equations multipoint initial condition regarding dissipativity boundedness solutions invariance non-negativity nature equilibria local global stability investigated. study features behavior three-dimensional tumor growth model dynamics described terms densities three cells populations tumor cells healthy host cells eﬀector immune cells. upper lower bounds eﬀector immune trajectories positive domain feasible multipoint initial conditions tend equilibrium points. cases small tumor mass equilibrium point;
