{"title": "A modeling framework for contact, adhesion and mechano-transduction  between excitable deformable cells", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Cardiac myocytes are the fundamental cells composing the heart muscle. The propagation of electric signals and chemical quantities through them is responsible for their nonlinear contraction and dilatation. In this study, a theoretical model and a finite element formulation are proposed for the simulation of adhesive contact interactions between myocytes across the so-called gap junctions. A multi-field interface constitutive law is proposed for their description, integrating the adhesive and contact mechanical response with their electrophysiological behavior. From the computational point of view, the initial and boundary value problem is formulated as a structure-structure interaction problem, which leads to a straightforward implementation amenable for parallel computations. Numerical tests are conducted on different couples of myocytes, characterized by different shapes related to their stages of growth, capturing the experimental response. The proposed framework is expected to have impact on the understanding how imperfect mechano-transduction could lead to emergent pathological responses.
