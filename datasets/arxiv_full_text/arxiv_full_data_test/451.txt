{"title": "Steric interactions between mobile ligands facilitate complete wrapping  in passive endocytosis", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an ubiquitous process through which cells internalize biological or synthetic nanoscale objects, including viruses, unicellular parasites, and nanomedical vectors for drug or gene delivery. In passive endocytosis the cell plasma membrane wraps around the \"invader\" particle driven by ligand-receptor complexation. By means of theory and numerical simulations, here we demonstrate how particles decorated by freely diffusing and non-mutually-interacting (ideal) ligands are significantly more difficult to wrap than those where ligands are either immobile or interact sterically with each other. Our model rationalizes the relationship between uptake mechanism and structural details of the invader, such as ligand size, mobility and ligand/receptor affinity, providing a comprehensive picture of pathogen endocytosis and helping the rational design of efficient drug delivery vectors.
