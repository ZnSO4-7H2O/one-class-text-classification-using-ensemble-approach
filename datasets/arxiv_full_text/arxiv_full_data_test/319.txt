{"title": "A Probabilistic Framework for Quantifying Biological Complexity", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " One thing that discriminates living things from inanimate matter is their ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large abundance. From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells, microbial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations in biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies. This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an approach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures. However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity, that allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity which can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We hope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond earth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as observing when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be considered alive.

describe existing measures complexity although great many measures list exhaustive. several complexity measures find utility realms computation information. information theory shannon entropy string unknown characters used complexity measure measure predictable outcome string equivalently much information contains based probability possible character string. kolmogorov complexity known object minimum length program outputs object example strings containing many repetitions would lower complexity random. logical depth complexity measure somewhat similar kolmogorov complexity looking time

skeleton selectively within whole class objects. bound complexity sets object non-identical clearly share features relationship other establish relationship motifs exceeds approach examine complex patterns within non-identical structures comprised non-identical parts. extreme example find sets entirely different objects joined lengths string beach could construct using object vertex joined string edge. objects joined pairs would simple indeed could imagine plausible physical effects phenomenon. however particularly complex abundant i.e. complex pattern found multiple locations would consider biological agency involved. note characteristics lengths string shapes object considered connected structures could entirely different sizes made completely different things identical complex connectivity motif common would enough make judgement probability naturally occurring origin perspective alone. order assess reasonable threshold given objects examine likelihood objects varying complexity constructed randomly example examine large random text string look abundance repeating fragments certain size idea abundance repeated fragments increasing size drops size increases. illustrate point generated random string characters plotted number repeats string fragments different sizes size plot number repeated units drops dramatically repeats length splicing word complex

size finding abundance repeated strings size suggests internal structure. reasonable threshold sigma higher random data suggesting find abundance repeats greater sizes biosignature. lthough useful indicator thresholding exercise capture full details complexity measure. stochastic model currently development give accurate assessment populations larger structures found amongst structures variant concept pathway complexity described called recursive tree complexity. variant establish complexity pathway partitioning object graph number different subgraphs. complexity pathway established complexity unique subgraph plus number times duplicated. subgraph single vertex contributes complexity. procedure repeated recursively unique subgraphs adding complexity time duplicated entire structure eventually broken single-vertex graphs. partitioning gives lowest total complexity defined recursive tree complexity. recursive tree variant provides slightly different model natural construction objects. variant parts come together make particular substructure cannot leveraged create multiple completely different structures. recursive tree variant think different structures developing separately brought together rather structures available times pool. pathway recursive tree variant also made pathway complexity process shortest pathway include redundant steps. thus recursive tree complexity upper bound pathway complexity. note also since pathway complexity first step joining step recursive tree variant effectively single fundamental structure first equivalent
