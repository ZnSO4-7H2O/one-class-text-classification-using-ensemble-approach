{"title": "Deceptiveness of internet data for disease surveillance", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Quantifying how many people are or will be sick, and where, is a critical ingredient in reducing the burden of disease because it helps the public health system plan and implement effective outbreak response. This process of disease surveillance is currently based on data gathering using clinical and laboratory methods; this distributed human contact and resulting bureaucratic data aggregation yield expensive procedures that lag real time by weeks or months. The promise of new surveillance approaches using internet data, such as web event logs or social media messages, is to achieve the same goal but faster and cheaper. However, prior work in this area lacks a rigorous model of information flow, making it difficult to assess the reliability of both specific approaches and the body of work as a whole.  We model disease surveillance as a Shannon communication. This new framework lets any two disease surveillance approaches be compared using a unified vocabulary and conceptual model. Using it, we describe and compare the deficiencies suffered by traditional and internet-based surveillance, introduce a new risk metric called deceptiveness, and offer mitigations for some of these deficiencies. This framework also makes the rich tools of information theory applicable to disease surveillance. This better understanding will improve the decision-making of public health practitioners by helping to leverage internet-based surveillance in a way complementary to the strengths of traditional surveillance.

concrete example illustrate encoding decoding components traditional surveillance communication united states’ seasonal inﬂuenza reporting system ilinet featureful traditional surveillance systems. ilinet produces incidence estimates inﬂuenza-like-illness symptoms consistent inﬂuenza lack nonﬂu explanation well-known surveillance systems include european surveillance system foodborne diseases active surveillance network united states’ arboviral surveillance system data ilinet collected roughly voluntarily reporting sentinel provider clinics one-week interval reporting providers count total

important rare diseases signal noise ratio greatest concern monitoring focused. example provider sees case rabies must report contrast ilinet captures sample seasonal cases. patient populations diﬀer

aﬀect suggests traditional surveillance might improved better addressing sample bias. bias could reduced sampling seeking care e.g. random telephone surveys general population symptoms could better

example newly infected person chooses seek care much decision random chance much systematic bias? present work address this imagine additional parameters quantify distinction. unobservable ratio |pv| estimated diﬃculty must test entire population seek care symptomatic. sero-prevalence study looks antibodies blood members population; provides direct evidence past infection rates random noise. nevertheless frequently provides high-quality data great social value. example distinction case inﬂuenza case non-inﬂuenza respiratory disease ﬂu-like symptoms often immaterial clinical resource

available suﬃcient many purposes. accordingly traditional surveillance much common internet-based surveillance next explore. contrast traditional surveillance based data gathered direct observation individual patients internet-based disease surveillance conjectures traces people’s internet activity drive useful incidence estimation model. thus shannon communication diﬀers corresponding implications challenges accuracy. rather diagnosis counts made health care providers features internet surveillance arise counting deﬁned classes activity traces; thus much numerous. example wikipedia contains million encyclopedia articles across languages versus ilinet providers. corollary traditional features oﬀer useful information design internet-based features result complex guided emergent human behavior thus overwhelmingly non-informative. internet features provide useful information incidence might. example number times wikipedia article inﬂuenza requested given week plausibly informs estimate basketball george bush not. trace counts comprise features. example infection interval number requests every wikipedia article generated. added signal systematic noise random noise thus features observable decoder familiar signal noise internet features diﬀerent unit traditional features. traditional surveillance symbol feature units person speciﬁc infection status assigned positive

parameterized model linear model contains parameters must estimated. done ﬁtting model reference data usually incidence estimates traditional surveillance system. denote reference data linear model

bound traditional surveillance. quantitative statistical estimates require quantitative reference data traditional surveillance form available. internet surveillance thus inherits many traditional surveillance’s ﬂaws; example reference data biased internet estimates share bias. however internet estimates important advantages timeliness cost information pipeline conﬁgured entirely automated. contexts like u.s. weeks speed advantage modest contexts traditional surveillance lags months entire season critical limits applicability internet-based surveillance. outbreaks likely occur features suﬃciently deceptiveness making impossible surveil reliably internet data. true even ﬁtting yields low-error model ﬁtting seeks correlation rather causality; recall basketball problem. models address estimating deceptiveness down-weighting features high deceptiveness. thus accurately estimating deceptiveness important. explore below. internet surveillance suﬀers sample bias multiple ways. first diseaserelated activity traces given internet system reﬂect people’s responses real world including reﬂections health status people observe internet varies systematically based factors related health status demographics; turn activity traces vary systematically factors. example social media tends modestly skewed demographic variables studied including gender race education income urban/rural second unit mismatch message signal increase bias. example might hypothesize younger person respiratory symptoms might post messages situation older person symptoms. systematically true number activity traces additionally biased user bias noted above. opportunity bias shared traditional surveillance. however ﬁtting process compensates biases. example overrepresented among systems’ users evident activity traces gendered traces down-weighted correcting overrepresentation. thus resulting estimates roughly biased reference data. issue problem internet surveillance assumption intervals false. example modern search sites positive feedback people search system notices oﬀers suggestions search thus increasing number searches infection. models address treating time realistically. opportunities include explicit model terms smooth variation leveraging deceptiveness estimates exclude deceptive features including data sources estimate current sample bias though taking advantage opportunities well challenging. argue order internet-based surveillance proposal credible must address signal-to-noise ratio drift issues using careful quantitative application-aware methods. hand static sample bias addressed simply following best practices. propose assessment options next section. error internet-based models easily computed reference data observable even passage time true error observable either. consequences. first imperfections traditional surveillance evident error metric; thus prudent evaluate multiple reference data. second simulation studies known important properly evaluating proposed approach. deceptiveness adds additional problem depends quantitative relationship features causal relationship well. makes fundamentally unknowable even perfect reference

deceptive period replacing linear interpolation. bottom google’s proprietary machine learning algorithms used identify count searches likely related disease rather occurrences search string. related articles reduced error models also reduce risk monitoring carefully breakdown coincidental correlation makes deceptive features troublesome. point situation hopeless eﬀective internet-based models must grapple quantitatively deceptiveness. argue successfully plausible; compare features figure figure properly designed internet-based surveillance might almost accurate traditional surveillance
