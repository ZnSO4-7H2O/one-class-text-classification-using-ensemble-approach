{"title": "What constitutes elemental shape information for biological vision?", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We do not yet understand how the vertebrate visual system provides for recognition of ob- jects. Countless experiments have been performed to examine the contribution of cues such as color, texture, and shadowing, but the most important cues are the con- tours of the outer boundary. Most objects that we can name can be identified as a silhouette, or equally well as a line drawing of the boundary. This has long been ap- preciated, so it is somewhat surprising that after more than a century of experimental research, we have not yet established how our visual system encodes this shape in- formation.
