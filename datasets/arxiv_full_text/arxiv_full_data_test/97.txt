{"title": "Long-range synchrony and emergence of reentry in neural networks", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Synchronization across long neural distances is a functionally important phenomenon. In order to access the mechanistic basis of long-range synchrony, we constructed an experimental model that enables monitoring of spiking activities over centimeter scale distances in large random networks of cortical neutrons. We show that the mode of synchrony over these distances depends upon a length scale, $\\lambda$, which is the minimal path that activity should travel through before meeting its point of origin ready for reactivation. When $\\lambda$ is experimentally made larger than the physical dimension of the network, distant neuronal populations operate synchronously, giving rise to irregularly occurring network-wide events that last hundreds of milliseconds to couple of seconds. In contrast, when $\\lambda$ approaches the dimension of the network, a continuous self-sustained reentry propagation emerges, a regular dynamical mode that is marked by precise spatiotemporal patterns (`synfire chains') that may last many minutes. These results contribute to discussions on the origin of different modes of neural synchrony in normal and pathological conditions ", "text": "neural synchronization across long distances functionally important phenomenon. order access mechanistic basis long-range synchrony constructed experimental model enables monitoring spiking activities centimeter scale networks cortical neurons. show mode synchrony distances depends upon length scale minimal path activity travel meeting point origin ready reactivation. experimentally made larger physical dimension network distant neuronal populations operate synchronously giving rise irregularly occurring network-wide events last hundreds milliseconds several seconds. contrast approaches dimension network continuous self-sustained reentry propagation emerges regular dynamical mode marked precise spatiotemporal patterns last many minutes. termination reentry phase decrease propagation speed halt. results contribute discussions origin diﬀerent modes neural synchrony normal pathological conditions. mode synchrony neural network resumes critical determinant function. number microscopic mechanisms impact macroscopic mode synchrony immense. extract lumped physical parameter show value controls mode synchrony network biological neurons. promotes understanding synchrony modes otherwise masked richness underlying microscopic complexity. hope insights gained study cater manipulation phenomena pathological conditions. spontaneous synchronization remote neural networks hallmarks brain activity considered signiﬁcant multiple functions health disease such study mechanisms underlying longrange synchronized activity substantial interest. cortex long range centimeter scale synchronization involves interplay statistics synaptic connectivity amongst excitatory neurons global eﬀect rapidly propagated activity electrically coupled inhibitory neurons many diﬀerent microscopic parameters cellular synaptic levels impact interplay excitation inhibition interested exposing global physical parameter mediates translation many microscopic mechanisms macroscopic modes long-range synchrony. parametrization useful analyzing cardiac reentry arrhythmias measurements cyclic brain activity suggest similar approach might instructive case neural synchrony take advantage reduced experimental model large-scale networks composed randomly connected cortical neurons. show mode synchrony sensitive characteristic length scale product parameters time scale individual synchronous event multiplied speed activity propagation length scale exceeds longest propagation path oﬀered network system acts single compartment active simultaneously. contrast characteristic length scale range propagation paths supported network self-sustained activities appear similar familiar reentrant dynamics cardiac arrhythmia. manipulate relevant parameters using pharmacological blockade gabaa mediated inhibition show relations determine global mode synchrony networkwide simultaneous activity occurs irregularly regular ongoing reentry dynamics last many minutes runs temporally precise synﬁre-chains. allowed develop couple weeks outside brain population cortical neurons tends form largescale network exhibits complex spontaneous activity. spontaneous activity characteristically composed synchronous events occur irregularly average rate interspersed uncorrelated sporadic activities temporal envelope synchronous event usually monitored integrating spiking activities detected many individual electrodes arranged array. cases millimeter scale electrode array positioned center large-scale network monitored relatively dense array electrodes center time scale single synchronous event single network spike order hundred milliseconds depicted figure discussed elsewhere order adjust standard experimental design subject matter present study involves distances order magnitude larger constructed electrode array layout consisting four clusters cover signiﬁcantly wider area appreciated examples provided middle right panels figure activity integrated distances apparent time scale single synchronous figure recording long-range synchronization. scheme standard centered array electrodes. three examples spiking activity monitored array shown middle panel. point depicts single spike detected electrodes synchronous events presented higher temporal resolution right-hand panel. superposed gray line shows normalized summed activity similar presentation activity recorded using layout electrodes arranged four clusters recording regions arrows demonstrate duration activation regions respective colors. region wherefrom synchronous activity initiated varies synchronous events. figure shows path propagation amongst four regions uniquely determined region activity initiation;
