{"title": "Parameter Estimation, Sensitivity Analysis and Optimal Control of a  Periodic Epidemic Model with Application to HRSV in Florida", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A state wide Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) surveillance system was implemented in Florida in 1999 to support clinical decision-making for prophylaxis of premature infants. The research presented in this paper addresses the problem of fitting real data collected by the Florida HRSV surveillance system by using a periodic SEIRS mathematical model. A sensitivity and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model is done and an optimal control problem is formulated and solved with treatment as the control variable.
