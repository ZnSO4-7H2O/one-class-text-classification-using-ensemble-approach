{"title": "Ubiquitous nucleosome unwrapping in the yeast genome", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Nucleosome core particle is a dynamic structure -- DNA may transiently peel off the histone octamer surface due to thermal fluctuations or the action of chromatin remodeling enzymes. Partial DNA unwrapping enables easier access of DNA-binding factors to their target sites and thus may provide a dominant pathway for effecting rapid and robust access to DNA packaged into chromatin. Indeed, a recent high-resolution map of distances between neighboring nucleosome dyads in \\emph{S.cerevisiae} shows that at least 38.7\\% of all nucleosomes are partially unwrapped. The extent of unwrapping follows a stereotypical pattern in the vicinity of genes, reminiscent of the canonical pattern of nucleosome occupancy in which nucleosomes are depleted over promoters and well-positioned over coding regions. To explain these observations, we developed a biophysical model which employs a 10-11 base pair periodic nucleosome energy profile. The profile, based on the pattern of histone-DNA contacts in nucleosome crystal structures and the idea of linker length discretization, accounts for both nucleosome unwrapping and higher-order chromatin structure. Our model reproduces the observed genome-wide distribution of inter-dyad distances, and accounts for patterns of nucleosome occupancy and unwrapping around coding regions. At the same time, our approach explains \\emph{in vitro} measurements of accessibility of nucleosome-covered binding sites, and of nucleosome-induced cooperativity between DNA-binding factors. We are able to rule out several alternative scenarios of nucleosome unwrapping as inconsistent with the genomic data.
