{"title": "LET-99-dependent spatial restriction of active force generators makes  spindle's position robust", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " During the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode zygote, the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindle's final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.
