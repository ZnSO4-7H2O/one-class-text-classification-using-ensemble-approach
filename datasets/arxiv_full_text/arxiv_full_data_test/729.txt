{"title": "Gene expression for simulation of biological tissue", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " BioDynaMo is a biological processes simulator developed by an international community of researchers and software engineers working closely with neuroscientists. The authors have been working on gene expression, i.e. the process by which the heritable information in a gene - the sequence of DNA base pairs - is made into a functional gene product, such as protein or RNA. Typically, gene regulatory models employ either statistical or analytical approaches, being the former already well understood and broadly used. In this paper, we utilize analytical approaches representing the regulatory networks by means of differential equations, such as Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. The two solutions are implemented and have been submitted for inclusion in the BioDynaMo project and are compared for accuracy and performance.
