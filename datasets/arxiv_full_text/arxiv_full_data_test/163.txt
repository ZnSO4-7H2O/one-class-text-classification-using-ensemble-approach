{"title": "Measuring Consciousness", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " A measurement based formula for consciousness, C, as a function of time t, is constructed. The formula depends on identifying a natural relevant self-generated, time-dependent dynamical process inherent in any entity. For human beings the relevant dynamical process identified is the ensemble of brain waves, observed in EEG measurements, that are represented in the model by their measured time dependent correlation functions. These correlation functions define the accessible dynamical state of the brain at any moment of time. From them a time dependent probability function, P(t), is extracted by using a mathematical identity. According to information theory, -P(t) log P(t), is a measure of the information contained in the brain waves. Consciousness, C, is defined by this information theory formula: it is not localized, does not depend on specific hardwire details of the brain, but reflects the information content present in brain waves. Justifications, based on observational evidence, are given for the formula and it is shown that C reflects the degree of \"awareness\" that a person has at a given moment of time. The model explains the observed time delay between when a brain wave is seen to initiate an action and when there is awareness that the action has been initiated, in terms of the way brain waves processes information. Some testable consequences of the model, including the role dreaming sleep plays in long term memory storage, are discussed. It is also shown that non living entities have C=0.

properties. ﬁrst property brain waves provide accesible means exploring dynamical state brain. supported neuroscience research quote northoﬀ makes point well. physical activity relationally determined brain encode neural activity relationally determined way. measurements measure brain’s neural activity. method technical limitations scalp measurements cannot probe subcortical neural properties. however variety tools available study neural oscillations neural correlation functions fmri second property brain waves constantly interact memory centers brain. well known brain waves play important role memory formation however establish presence constant interaction brain waves memory centers important implies brain waves contain personal subjective experiences. supported feature comes observations colgin others found brain waves carrying incoming information access memory centers brain many times second. done order interpret nature coming information process comparison memory creates awareness person regarding nature incoming signal. memories subjective conclude brain waves carry subjective information. stressed brain wave patterns given moment time contain small fraction available information dynamic brain. nature information dependent areas brain probed time environment. third property strong clinical evidence linking memory consciousness. numerous works topic. tulving provides empirical observational support links diﬀerent memory systems corresponding varieties consciousness related particular episodic memory autonoetic consciousness necessary correlate. procedural memory included tulving’s list form memory contribute consciousness sense awareness. thus consciousness associated form memory tulving calls anoetic consciousness. implicit memories contribute awareness include self regulatory centers living system regulate breathing heart beats body temperature absence memories would consciousness human being. memory discussed tulving others cited thus necessary consciousness. consciousness memory same. consciousness moment-to-moment feature living systems memory provides continuity person’s self contributes content conscious awareness also provides information necessary person survive world. conclude measure consciousness proposed useful contains subjective information. hard problem consciousness model thus decode brain wave

brain wave patterns mapped events external world imprint memory present studied. unfolding time three dimensional surface representing distribution values result incoming signal interacting memory. unfolding time expected fraction second rather milliseconds. finally brieﬂy address conceptual issue regarding consciousness information related model. basic idea model construct speciﬁc measure consciousness terms information content brain extracted measurements. used measured brain wave information access information content dynamic brain used procedure construct measure consciousness. hypothesis made link supported clinical research brain waves memory memory consciousness memories contain subjective information hence hypothesis consciousness related rate brain processes information reasonable. information relevant human consciousness associated brain time dependent ability constantly change response external input signals embedded interactively generated memory system consciousness feature system. however model determine degree consciousness given information function simply determining value obtained interpreted degree consciousness system information function clear speciﬁc measure attribute attribute. thus abstract information without qualiﬁcations conscious approach follows standard practice science namely system speciﬁed abstract idea information contained system determined observation using mathematical ideas speciﬁc hypothesis made linking rate processing brain wave information human consciousness. hypothesis tested. test check degree awareness person related frequency brain wave oscillations. discuss result shortly. modeling physical system similar sequence steps followed. system interest identiﬁed suitable relevant abstract ideas like electromagnetic ﬁeld energy entropy identiﬁed extracted measurements help theoretical ideas abstract ideas used draw testable conclusions regarding system. example notion entropy listed underpins statistical mechanics used study thermal properties systems. abstract concept entropy formulated using information theory systems thermal equilibrium information content time independent hence system’s consciousness zero. measure consciousness proposed testable consequences. stated example measure predicts positive correlation brain wave frequency degree consciousness. prediction follows formula proposed show. however observational level known person deep sleep coma brain injury have predominantly slow delta waves leading small value states higher brain wave frequencies representing higher levels awareness larger values statement requires clariﬁcation. sleep high frequency gamma waves frequency theta waves present. however gamma waves also present alpha beta waves occur. thus sleep lower value states alpha beta waves present. sleep value higher person undergoing epileptic absence seizure even though state high activity. dicotonomy observed brain waves epileptic absence seizure high amplitudes frequencies cici represents contributions consciousness ensemble brain waves delta theta alpha beta gamma brain waves them probabilities .... expression average allowed potentials implimented directly single probability type brain wave. call replacement mean ﬁeld approximation. numbers weights constant given moment time waves present value weights depend state awareness. thus state deep sleep dominates awake state dominates. states gamma wave component present. next note dimensionless numbers related probability functions. dimensionless requires dimensionless function namely ωit. follows shown quyen gamma waves always present wake-rem sleep cycle factor roughly states absent epileptic absence seizures. thus level consciousness epileptic absent seizure lower sleep although considerable neural activity present. sketch given makes number simplifying assumptions clearly links brain wave frequencies. another important consequence approach explicitly notes consciousness life depend presence external internal time dependent sources responsible observed time dependence brain wave signals. observation means consciousness determined simply hard-wiring person’s brain rather many factors. self model? provided operational deﬁnition based experimental results self initiates thoughts actions know provides sense person time. notion continuity
