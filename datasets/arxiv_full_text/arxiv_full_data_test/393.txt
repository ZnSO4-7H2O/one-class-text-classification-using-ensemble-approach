{"title": "Landscape and flux for quantifying global stability and dynamics of game  theory", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Game theory has been widely applied to many areas including economics, biology and social sciences. However, it is still challenging to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. We developed a landscape and flux framework to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. As an example, we investigated the models of three-strategy games: a special replicator-mutator game, the repeated prison dilemma model. In this model, one stable state, two stable states and limit cycle can emerge under different parameters. The repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system has Hopf bifurcation transitions from one stable state to limit cycle state, and then to another one stable state or two stable states, or vice versa. We explored the global stability of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system and the kinetic paths between the basins of attractor. The paths are irreversible due to the non-zero flux. One can explain the game for $Peace$ and $War$.
