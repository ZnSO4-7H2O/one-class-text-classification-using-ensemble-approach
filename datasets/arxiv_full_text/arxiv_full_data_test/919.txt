{"title": "Selection dynamics in transient compartmentalization", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Transient compartments have been recently shown to be able to maintain functional replicators in the context of prebiotic studies. Motivated by this experiment, we show that a broad class of selection dynamics is able to achieve this goal. We identify two key parameters, the relative amplification of non-active replicators (parasites) and the size of compartments. Since the basic ingredients of our model are the competition between a host and its parasite, and the diversity generated by small size compartments, our results are relevant to various phage-bacteria or virus-host ecology problems.
