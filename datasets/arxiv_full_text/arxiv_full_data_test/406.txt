{"title": "Computational Psychiatry in Borderline Personality Disorder", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Purpose of review: We review the literature on the use and potential use of computational psychiatry methods in Borderline Personality Disorder.  Recent findings: Computational approaches have been used in psychiatry to increase our understanding of the molecular, circuit, and behavioral basis of mental illness. This is of particular interest in BPD, where the collection of ecologically valid data, especially in interpersonal settings, is becoming more common and more often subject to quantification. Methods that test learning and memory in social contexts, collect data from real-world settings, and relate behavior to molecular and circuit networks are yielding data of particular interest.  Summary: Research in BPD should focus on collaborative efforts to design and interpret experiments with direct relevance to core BPD symptoms and potential for translation to the clinic.

mental illness. models parse complex data sets giving insight problems like psychological processes might instantiated neural machinery patterns large data sets make prognostic inferences review several examples computational work relevance bpd. i.a. behavioral tasks query specific aspects cognition method conduct behavioral experiments subjects play multi-trial games designed query specific aspects perception learning memory. trial-by-trial subject responses computational models yielding mathematical estimates subjects’ decision processes electrophysiology fmri data linked parameter

cognitive processes example patient group differ controls pharmacologic intervention differs placebo. social cues trials decision-making game wherein participants weigh types information making choices. first consider experiences reward contingencies hand meet interact another player game advice choice make trial. know player’s goals aligned own. importantly probability reward color advice vary separately course game. non-psychiatric control subjects develop beliefs play much trust colors advice. dimensions social symptoms. recent collaborative effort computational clinical researchers

cell-type specific properties circuit function. increasing biological plausibility expands number junctures facts behavioral neuroscience leveraged model ultimately exploited clinically. example models reward noveltyseeking behavior could emphasize roles dopamine neurotransmission control precision/uncertainty sensory prediction errors well cholinergic regions brainstem noradrenergic locus coeruleus encoding expected versus unexpected uncertainty models based predictive coding hold cognition perception understood terms prior predictions inputs discrepancies prediction actual inputs precision predictions errors. precision governs weighting representation towards initial prediction towards error assumption slower catecholaminergic neurotransmitters mediate precision neural hierarchies. example acetylcholine codes precision visual perceptual predictions oxytocin code precision inferential hierarchy governs social beliefs. i.c. common tasks models deployed across species experiments also designed task deployed different model systems example decision-making tasks performed patients mouse models. example relevant testing effects social rejection. people social rejection leads alterations subsequent social behavior decreased pain sensitivity rodents adolescent social rejection produces effects behavior pain tolerance mirror results human subjects innovative
