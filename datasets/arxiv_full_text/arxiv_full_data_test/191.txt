{"title": "Energy-based Analysis of Biomolecular Pathways", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Decomposition of biomolecular reaction networks into pathways is a powerful approach to the analysis of metabolic and signalling networks. Current approaches based on analysis of the stoichiometric matrix reveal information about steady-state mass flows (reaction rates) through the network. In this work we show how pathway analysis of biomolecular networks can be extended using an energy-based approach to provide information about energy flows through the network. This energy-based approach is developed using the engineering-inspired bond graph methodology to represent biomolecular reaction networks.  The approach is introduced using glycolysis as an exemplar; and is then applied to analyse the efficiency of free energy transduction in a biomolecular cycle model of a transporter protein (Sodium-Glucose Transport Protein 1, SGLT1).  The overall aim of our work is to present a framework for modelling and analysis of biomolecular reactions and processes which considers energy flows and losses as well as mass transport.
