therefore process poisson process waiting time till next event occurs follows exponential distribution i.e. follows proof ends. assume process organisms take actions poisson process decide waiting

species loops constitute demographic structure shown fig. referring paper supplementary material section another example species loops intuition gillespie algorithm process organisms take actions poisson process number events—an event means organism take action—in time interval follows poisson distribution parameter i.e. e−λτk number events. prove waiting time current event next event follows exponential distribution parameter follows. common term q—the probability able obtain metabolites—represents birth process. term appears probability unable obtain enough metabolites. thus represents death process. therefore model birth death processes monod scheme birth process. note unit time model basically doubling time organisms. short-term experiments e.g. doubling time monod equation makes sense since organisms survive doubling times even without taking food. however long-term experiments starvation taken account. addition interested living organisms dead organisms need excluded. overall scheme makes sense. feels unnatural another think results identical equations above nmetabolite system species excretes based addition base- numeral system settings resulted double-digit

distinguished former refers excretion waste product thus cost producer cooperative cross-feeding refers excretion costly producer up-front investment paid back partner species using excretion. therefore number soup model talks incidental cross-feeding without involving cooperative cross-feeding. perspective model particularly distinguish sequential reciprocal cross-feeding appear. reﬂections cooperators cheaters question ecology cooperators cheaters could coexist since cheaters always beneﬁts anything back. authors claim spatial eﬀects would promote maintain coexistence however possible coexistence environment homogeneous well-mixed? according number soup model besides nonspatial models answer yes. note model deals incidental cross-feeding means cooperation carries cost. meanings cooperators cheaters section narrower normal deﬁnitions. like connor called pseudo-reciprocity suggested many mutualism scenarios partners largely passive bear costs interaction example cooperators cheaters coexist fig. system considering demographic structure dominate fraction would cheater respect pair cooperators produce needed cooperator consumes metabolites needed simulations

reﬂections investigations. number soup model system collapses rare existence keystone species quite common. question naturally raised although think systems could able persist long time. context model question answered systematically investigating statistics time till collapse. whole system. number soup model observed mutation biodiversity help prolong whole system. extinct species could possibly regenerated mutations. bell’s generalised predator-prey model also observed mutations prolong existence trophically complex communities. however context natural ecosystems mutations quick enough regenerate extinct keystone species similar species. instead role played mutations could replaced biodiversity. rich biodiversity species take vacant niche appeared extinction keystone species

collapse. situations system abruptly switches another demographic structure sometimes also large ﬂuctuations beforehand could considered incomplete collapse followed recovery. therefore observing whether ﬂuctuations unexpectedly large extracting early-warning signals might able tell whether collapse number soup model reason resources consumed eﬃciently birth rate organisms high population always gets saturated fully consume resources. real world microbes consume resources reproduce much possible similar number soup model. larger organisms birds mammals etc. seem reproduce much possible least resources would consumed fast microbes large organisms fully consume resources? superﬁcially birth rate. large organisms birth rate? guesses since large organisms large resource consumers reproduce fast would consume resources quickly evolution selects large organisms birth rate; birth rate physiological constraints e.g. large bodies large complex reproduce faster. ﬁrst guess investigated number soup model setting diﬀerent birth death rate whether organisms high birth rate high probabilities out. alternatively community under-populated over-populated easier extinct? another point view high birth rate beneﬁcial individual organism could deleterious whole species namely deleterious system level. question raised tradeoﬀ birth rate individual level system level?
