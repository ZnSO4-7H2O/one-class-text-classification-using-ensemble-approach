{"title": "Cell-Cycle-Associated Amplified Genomic-DNA Fragments (CAGFs) Might Be  Involved in Chloroquine Action and Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " As a cheap and safe antimalarial agent, chloroquine (CQ) has been used in the battle against malaria for more than half century. However, the mechanism of CQ action and resistance in Plasmodium falciparum remains elusive. Based on further analysis of our published experimental results, we propose that the mechanism of CQ action and resistance might be closely linked with cell-cycle-associated amplified genomic-DNA fragments (CAGFs, singular form = CAGF) as CQ induces CAGF production in P. falciparum, which could affect multiple biological processes of the parasite, and thus might contribute to parasite death and CQ resistance. Recently, we found that CQ induced one of CAGFs, UB1- CAGF, might downregulate a probable P. falciparum cystine transporter (Pfct) gene expression, which could be used to understand the mechanism of CQ action and resistance in P. falciparum.

chemotherapy diminished resistance falciparum cq’s story continues recent years found enhance efficacy various anticancer drugs signifying renaissance miracle drug. however date mechanism action resistance falciparum remains controversial. briefly main hypotheses regarding mechanism action resistance falciparum could named food-vacuole hypothesis states cq’s action site food vacuole toxic heme resulted cq’s blockade hemozoin formation kills malaria parasite food-vacuole membrane proteins pfmdr pfcrt responsible resistance another could named nucleus hypothesis claims cq’s action site nucleus causes damage intercalation apoptosis defective repair alteration damage regulation might also contribute resistance proposed site action resistance development nucleus malaria parasite falciparum resistance marker protein might cq’s target nucleus recently reported falciparum produces cell-cycle-associated amplified genomic-dna fragments certain points intraerythrocytic cycle induce cagf production paper present results analysis findings might contribute understanding mechanism action resistance falciparum. based analysis published experimental results propose mechanism action

contribute parasite death resistance. cell-cycle-associated amplified genomic-dna fragments discovered purely chance briefly years order check whether could cause damage falciparum cq-sensitive isolate cq-resistant isolate treated different doses parasite samples harvested intervals start treatment genomic harvested samples isolated. using isolated genomic performed arbitrarily-primed single arbitrary primer named initially thought damage banding patterns exactly samples damage number bands would reduced damage means quantity quality templates reduced. control groups undoubtedly banding pattern remain samples. however contrary anticipation banding patterns control treated groups exhibited cell-cycle dependent changes caused unstable bands control groups isolates appeared respectively whereas cq-treated groups appeared samples isolates. furthermore cq-treated groups much clearer control groups indicating induces production isolates. appearance disappearance different points parasite’s intraerythrocytic cycle suggest copy number ubub-related templates increased decreased accordingly cellcycle progression. named ubub-related templates ubub-related cagfs simplified ub-cagf ub-cagf. here word amplified refers multiple copies mean gene amplification ubub-related templates increased amplification amplified templates would incorporated genome would disappear hours later. besides amplification induced start treatment. therefore speculate cagfs single-stranded fragments molecules released genome nucleoplasm. mechanism cagfs produced released genome unknown proposed three possible mechanisms include dna-polymerase dependent transcription endonuclease dependent transcript cutout genoautotomy originally speculated endonuclease dependent transcript cutout genoautotomy mainly non-coding region think active transcription region might main target recently found sequence belongs coding sequence gene. following section ub-cagf related gene’s function association action resistance falciparum described detail. cagf mainly comes coding region gene enormous implications biological science. first since cagf originates coding region sequence complimentary either sense antisence-strand sequence transcription region gene located within transcription region could named cagf-related gene. thus ssdna molecule cagf downregulate cagf-related gene expression either antisense antigene strategies second cagf generation endonuclease dependent transcript cutout genoautotomy transient ssdna caused releasing cagf formed transcription region complete repair gap. cagf ssdna belong ssdna prone mutations double-stranded furthermore certain small fragments cagfs could serve intrinsic mutation-contained primers might involved natural site-directed mutagenesis therefore cagf generation cell cycle might contribute drug resistance evolution; third cagfs released cell cell-free blood stream mammals might serve mobile genetic elements involved horizontal vertical genetic transfer. since cagfs might carry genetic epigenetic alterations gene might involved inheritance acquired characteristics vertical genetic transfer. taken together cagfs might wide range biological functions main function downregulation cagf-related gene expression required normal cell cycle progression. mentioned above cagf’s main function downregulation cagf-related gene expression. published paper cagfs i.e. ub-cagf ubcagf reported means cagf-related genes ub-cagf related gene ub-cagf related gene could downregulated ub-cagf ub-cagf respectively. however till partial ub-cagf cloned sequenced therefore section mainly focus function gene downregulated ub-cagf might contribute action resistance falciparum. years cloned sequenced band obtained sequence shares amino acid similarity unknown gene escherichia coli accession number changed pabt uniprotkb. recently found pabt named probable cystine transporter yije suggests ub-cagf comes transcription region might harbour probable falciparum cystine transporter gene. surprising finding gene reported falciparum might involved glutathione synthesis. probable cystine transporter yije gene encodes membrane protein involved response cystine coli overexpression protein confers tolerance excess cystine eukaryotic cells cystine transporter also called cystine/glutamate antiporter takes extracellular cystine exchange intracellular glutamate falciparum belongs eukaryote thus pfct function cystine/glutamate antiporter. since uptake cystine required intracellular synthesis pfct might play critical role intracellular synthesis also maintenance cystine deprivation induce efflux degradation cystine used synthesis falciparum might come haemoglobin digestion food vacuole parasite. therefore likely pfct located food-vacuole membrane transports cystine food vacuole synthesis. synthesized distributed intracellular compartments including nucleus exert antioxidant biological effects. action resistance falciparum might closely associated pfct reasons first according published paper bands h-hb control much clearer control suggesting cq-sensitive isolate produces ubub-cagfs cq-resistant isolate. less ub-cagf induction isolate means pfct expression synthesis isolate consistent previous report levels total higher cq-resistant falciparum isolate cq-sensitive falciparum isolate interestingly increased synthesis also found various drug-resistant cancer cell lines second dose effectively induce ubub-cagfs early stage intraerythrocytic cycle isolates difference isolates sustainability ubub-cagfs. isolate ubub-cagfs disappeared isolate ub-cagf disappeared indicating degradation ub-cagf isolate isolate table shows isolate isolate suggests induced ub-cagf downregulated pfct gene expression isolate severely isolate. thus concluded overall levels isolate higher isolate treatment. since plays important role antioxidant defence levels indicate antioxidant capacity make parasite vulnerable attack reactive oxygen species constantly produced oxidative metabolism serve major contributor oxidative damage carbohydrates nucleic acids lipids proteins furthermore depletion elicit apoptosis necrosis depletion nuclear impairs cell proliferation taken together might kill cq-sensitive falciparum inducing ub-cagf downregulates pfct expression decreases synthesis thus reduces antioxidant capacity making parasite vulnerable attack. among various oxidative damages caused damage might contribute largely parasite death. less production degradation extracellular release ub-cagf might contribute resistance falciparum. theoretically downregulation pfct expression ub-cagf closely linked action timing induced ub-cagf consistent timing parasite stages acts. induced ubcagf appeared early hours start treatment means parasite development early ring-form stage induces ub-cagf early ring-form stage parasite pfct expression stage greatly downregulated means less synthesis reduced antioxidant capacity therefore making stage parasite vulnerable attack. previous research shows late stages i.e. trophozoite schizont considerably sensitive ring-stage parasites coincident elevated glucose consumption nucleic acid synthesis explanation contradiction ring-form stage parasite might produce less late stage parasite less glucose metabolism involved regulation glucose metabolism glucose induce production main difference isolates cq’s induction ub-cagf induced ub-cagf sustained h-sample isolate disappeared h-sample isolate since h-sample equivalent late ring-form stage sample speculated levels late ring-form stage isolate higher late ring-form stage isolate used understand reason isolate insensitive treatment. clinical research shown acts principally large ring-form mature trophozoite stages falciparum consistent speculation. conclusion downregulation pfct expression ub-cagf closely linked action resistance falciparum. related gene’s function might also contribute action resistance besides addition induction ubub-cagfs might induce cagfs falciparum needs investigation. proposed falciparum resistance marker protein cq’s target nucleus genetic alterations pfcrmp gene correlated well resistance phenotype checking isolates three different regions pfcrmp’s function unknown might involved enhancement histone h-modulated chromatin structure required diverse bioprocesses transcription repair chromatin compaction cell division apoptosis reason assumption made pfcrmp contains dnmt-rfd domain potent histone binding domain since histone phosphorylation involved ros-mediated damage cell death possible binding wild-type pfcrmp might aberrantly induce chromatin-structure changes interaction histone make chromatin vulnerable attack. might induce chromatin-structure changes interaction mutant pfcrmp contributes resistance. discoveries cagfs pfcrmp falciparum strongly support idea site action resistance development within nucleus malaria parasite. diverse therapeutic actions might closely linked cq’s induction various cagfs. since cagfs might also produced induced eukaryotic cells cancer cells investigation area contribute understanding mechanism action resistance falciparum cancer cells also helps design novel drugs strategies tackle drug resistance various cancer cells. downregulation probable pfct gene expression ub-cagf novel mechanism intracellular levels regulated. proved many experimental results levels associated action resistance rodent malaria species berghei similar convincing evidence falciparum obtained doubt ub-cagf modulated pfct expression supports view plays important role action resistance falciparum. unfortunately years didn’t submit sequence genbank sequence gone missing. luckily
