{"title": "Spatial heterogeneity analyses identify limitations of epidemic alert  systems: Monitoring influenza-like illness in France", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Surveillance data serving for epidemic alert systems are typically fully aggregated in space. However, epidemics may be spatially heterogeneous, undergoing distinct dynamics in distinct regions of the surveillance area. We unveil this in retrospective analyses by classifying incidence time series. We use Pearson correlation to quantify the similarity between local time series and then classify them using modularity maximization. The surveillance area is thus divided into regions with different incidence patterns. We analyzed 31 years of data on influenza-like-illness from the French system Sentinelles and found spatial heterogeneity in 19/31 influenza seasons. However, distinct epidemic regions could be identified only 4-5 weeks after the nationwide alert. The impact of spatial heterogeneity on influenza epidemiology was complex. First, when the nationwide alert was triggered, 32-41% of the administrative regions were experiencing an epidemic, while the others were not. Second, the nationwide alert was timely for the whole surveillance area, but, subsequently, regions experienced distinct epidemic dynamics. Third, the epidemic dynamics were homogeneous in space. Spatial heterogeneity analyses can provide the timing of the epidemic peak and finish, in various regions, to tailor disease monitoring and control.

methodology estimate number epidemic regions identify catchment areas included epidemic region analyses organized according following steps assessment time-series interdependence. consider pair catchment areas corresponding time series versus other using linear model. case missing data select data common time points. adjusted square coefficient determination used goodness characterizes correlation strength pair time series. also proportional square coefficient pearson correlation thus symmetric time series defining reflexive relationship similarity. hence values pairs time series organized symmetric matrix. determination epidemic regions. consider matrix values adjacency matrix defining all-to-all undirected network weighted edges catchment areas nodes. classify time series corresponding catchment areas determining community structure all-to-all network using modularity maximization thus community contains nodes whose time series correlate well another forms epidemic region. contrast correlation time series catchment areas included different communities significantly weaker. modularity maximization employed algorithm unsupervised classification hierarchical clustering using measure similarity many classification schemes available. however modularity maximization simple implement numerically methodological shortcomings well documented tested numerical algorithms maximize modularity obtained similar results data. output single modularity maximization partition nodes number disjoint communities determined algorithm. fact node assigned numerical label community belongs. output organized vector community labels length equal number nodes. data structure fundamental analyses called modularity vector impact data uncertainty. epidemic regions result classifying relatively small numbers nodes whose features defined noisy data. bootstrap analyses establish robustness node classification respect noise. here organized according following three steps. surrogate datasets. built surrogates data point using normal distribution mean incidence estimate variance tuned corresponding confidence interval thus generated surrogate datasets analyzed according steps described above. bootstrap analyses. labeling communities serves particular purpose beyond single analysis. leads difficulties case many modularity vectors processed ensemble. even case nearly similar datasets processed yielding exactly partition community labeling differ leading different modularity vectors. however case align modularity vector first searching among permutations symbols relabeling communities makes modularity vector coincide first. principle works case datasets similar resulting modularity vectors correspond different similar partitions. general analysis bootstrap data yields ensemble modularity vectors number communities ranges maximum value cmax. value chose reference vector align follows. given modularity vectors respectively communities search among permutations symbols relabeling maximizes number identical symbols vectors. remaining modularity vectors quickly aligned reference vector corresponding value using similar procedure. alignment modularity vectors ensures community labeling analyses bootstrap data. summary statistics ensemble aligned modularity vectors ensemble aligned modularity vectors processed reveal distinctions node

data gathered beginning influenza season time national alert immediately after insufficient clear results. values high indicating data uncertainty strong impact results. furthermore aggregated time

weeks provided confirmation slightly increasing trend epidemic went extinct. important note that even detection epidemic regions occur later nationwide alert still offer critical information qualitative quantitative dynamics regional epidemics. example case influenza season robust detection epidemic regions obtained week global epidemic alert. inspection fig. reveals corresponds week

aggregated inform public health practitioners. example france epidemic alerts influenza given whole surveillance area based data aggregated national level. obvious statistical advantages aggregating

surveillance area undermines usefulness surveillance system. case influenza illustrates problem perfectly. burden seasonal influenza epidemics large western countries epidemic alert triggered national media campaigns prevention launched press radio messages hygiene vaccination. timing critical since vaccine-induced protection becomes effective weeks vaccination however concerning impact influenza

therefore important identify situations public health message designed national broadcast later supplemented customized information local practitioners. mapping incidence data already gives important clues epidemic heterogeneity furthermore gravity/radiation models could employed extensive spatiotemporal analyses including data fitting. however models make strong assumptions catchment areas must interact; i.e. gravity models assume interaction declines distance radiation models assume individuals spread like radiation fluxes. goal classifying spatiotemporal data made minimal assumptions geographical structure using concepts metapopulation theory discover spatial structure epidemics. still epidemic regions found cluster large extent neighboring catchment areas. regions distinct epidemic dynamics occur variety reasons. factors known influence transmission influenza susceptibility profile population circulating strains vaccine parameters vaccination patterns travel daily commuting school holidays weather. addition spatiotemporal coordinates individuals happen initiate influenza epidemics also important. therefore account spatial heterogeneity influenza starting first principles particularly challenging. strategy determine influenza epidemic regions directly using surveillance data analyzing local epidemic dynamics provided incidence time series. acknowledging spatial heterogeneity surveillance area identifying epidemic regions important consequences improving influenza monitoring control. operational value epidemic regions depends several items. first spatial resolution must appropriate here signal noise ratio small meaningful analysis nuts level sufficient defining epidemic regions nuts nuts level. relevant structure public health administration
