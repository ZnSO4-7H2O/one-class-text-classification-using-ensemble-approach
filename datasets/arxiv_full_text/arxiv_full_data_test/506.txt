{"title": "Hydro-osmotic instabilities in active membrane tubes", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " We study a membrane tube with unidirectional ion pumps driving an osmotic pressure difference. A pressure driven peristaltic instability is identified, qualitatively distinct from similar tension-driven Rayleigh type instabilities on membrane tubes. We discuss how this instability could be related to the function and biogenesis of membrane bound organelles, in particular the contractile vacuole complex. The unusually long natural wavelength of this instability is in agreement with that observed in cells.
