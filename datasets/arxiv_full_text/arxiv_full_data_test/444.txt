{"title": "Quantifying homologous proteins and proteoforms", "tag": "q-bio", "abstract": " Many proteoforms - arising from alternative splicing, post-translational modifications (PTMs), or paralogous genes - have distinct biological functions, such as histone PTM proteoforms. However, their quantification by existing bottom-up mass-spectrometry (MS) methods is undermined by peptide-specific biases. To avoid these biases, we developed and implemented a first-principles model (HIquant) for quantifying proteoform stoichiometries. We characterized when MS data allow inferring proteoform stoichiometries by HIquant, derived an algorithm for optimal inference, and demonstrated experimentally high accuracy in quantifying fractional PTM occupancy without using external standards, even in the challenging case of the histone modification code.

methylation histone cause either transcriptional activation repression depending modiﬁed lysine; pyruvate kinase isoforms different metabolic regulation activities roles aerobic glycolysis–. understanding systems demands quantifying proteoform abundances. demand motivated development external standards afford high accuracy even complex proteoforms. however wider limited expense applied special cases allow chemical modiﬁcation cell lysates e.g. phosphorylation acetylation. absence external standards quantiﬁcation complex proteoform stoichiometries remains challenging ratios proteoform-speciﬁc peptides necessarily reﬂect ratios corresponding proteoforms; precursor areas corresponding phospho-site sample differ -fold depending choice protease. discrepancy measured peptide level depends abundance corresponding protein also extraneous factors including protein digestion peptide ionization efﬁciency presence co-eluting peptides chromatographic aberrations–. extraneous factors break equivalence abundance peptide precursor area thus make protein quantiﬁcation much challenging infer proteoform stoichiometry simple model illustrated fig. proteoforms histone supplementary fig. paralogous ribosomal proteins phospho-proteoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase. hiquant explicitly models peptide levels measured across conditions superposition levels proteins peptides originate fig. model shared peptides serve indispensable internal standards;
